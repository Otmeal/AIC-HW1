https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/tanzania-soma-bags-reading-light-spc/index.html,"When Innocent James completed his chores after school, he would light a kerosene lamp and lay down to read his books. There was no electricity in James’ part of Arusha, a region in northern Tanzania, and so his family was forced to burn expensive oil for him to learn after dark.
Today, James is 33, and many parents in rural Tanzania – where all year round the sun sets at around 7pm – must still choose between saving money and allowing their children to read at night. But now, James’ company, Soma Bags, is providing a solution: backpacks equipped with solar panels that charge a reading light.
What started as a small-scale project with some discarded cement bags, a sewing machine, and a solar panel, has become a business attracting charities and fashion brands from around the world. Last year, Soma Bags (“Reading Bags” in Swahili) sold 36,000 solar backpacks to people across Africa, providing an invaluable energy source for when the sun goes down.
James was brought up by his mother and grandmother, both schoolteachers, to love reading.
At university in Mwanza, James was shocked at the number of schoolchildren he noticed on the street skipping class to ask for money, largely to spend in local video game cafés. He wanted to help them find the taste for learning that he remembered from his childhood.
“I was frustrated,” James said, “I could see that the problem was much, much bigger than I thought.”
Before his last semester, James dropped out of university and used the last of his tuition money to buy a mobile library cart. He began visiting schools, attracting hundreds of children to his reading clubs.
But for all his hard work, there was a problem: children would borrow books from him and then return them unread. James soon realized that while they were eager to read, they could not afford to do so.
Fewer than halfof households in mainland Tanzania are connected to electricity. This falls tojust over a thirdin rural areas. Consequently, many families rely on kerosene lamps to provide light after dark.
These lamps produce dim light and are expensive to fill. They also pollute the air and carry the risk of burns. Parents often opt to send their children to bed, James explained, rather than allowing them to use the lamp to read.
James’ solution – flexible solar panels sewn onto the outside of bags to power a reading light – was inspired by a university professor who carried around a solar charger for his phone, sewn into a fabric pouch. “It gave me the confidence that what I want is going to work,” said James.
He started in 2016 by handmaking 80 backpacks per month, sewing on a solar panel sourced from China that charged during the children’s walk to and from school. By the time they returned home, they would have enough power for a reading light. A fully charged bag can power a light for six to eight hours, meaning that one day of bright weather can allow for multiple nights of reading, even if cloudy weather arrives.
James says the solar backpacks are more affordable than using an oil lamp. A solar bag costs between 12,000 and 22,500 Tanzanian shillings (approximately $4-8), with the reading light included – the same price as 12-22.5 days of using a kerosene lamp, according to an average cost estimated in a survey of Soma Bags customers.
Sold mainly from his growing franchise of mobile library carts, the bags became popular, and James increased production. He founded Soma Bags in 2019 and oversaw the construction of his own factory in the village of Bulale, in the Mwanza region, in 2020. The company now employs 65 staff.
Made from repurposed cement bags found on the streets of Mwanza, where James lives, the backpack material is durable, lightweight, zero waste, and comes at no cost. The backpacks look good, too – in the middle of the bags, the white silhouette of a giraffe appears within bright yellow or green stripes.
“It’s innovative,” said Joseph Manirakiza, of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which has supported Soma Bags since 2023. “I never thought someone would think of turning waste cement bags into something useful.”
James’ customers are, in the main, families and schools in rural Tanzania – people and institutions with whom he is familiar from his library cart days. But the company is expanding; over 200 charities have bought bags from James to distribute amongst children in need, and Soma Bags is becoming increasingly popular in urban areas.
While inside Soma’s smaller backpacks are battery-powered reading lights, its bigger bags now have in-built charging systems with a greater capacity, enabling them to power other electronic devices, like phone chargers.
The company has also branched out into travel, sports, and cosmetic bags that aren’t solar-powered. James has sold backpacks to charities in Nigeria, Rwanda, Madagascar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to fashion brands in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Kenya.
Around 600 million Africans do not have access to electricity. Companies that produce solar-powered lamps are abundant on the continent,and the UN’s Solar Light Distribution Programme is part of a global effort to light up rural areas with affordable and sustainable energy.
The hybrid social enterprise Smart Girls Uganda has produced and distributed over 12,000 of its own solar bags to children in Africa. “It is important for multiple companies to produce solar-powered bags across the continent,” said its CEO, Jamila Mayanja. “It’s more than just lighting; it’s about giving them control over their education, their future, and ultimately helping to break the cycle of poverty in their communities.”
Soma Bags has been recognized by numerous awards and institutions, including the UNDP and theBritish government.
“There is a crop of young people [in Tanzania] who are coming up, and they have realized that they have to take the future into their own hands,” said Manirakiza. “Innocent represents a group of young people using their talent to do something meaningful.”
As his companycontinues to expand, James is becoming increasingly busy, but he still finds time to run reading groups for children from his mobile cart twice a week. Now, kids arrive for his readings with his bags on their backs.
“Sometimes I see a kid with the bag, and I’m like, wow,” said James, smiling, “I can’t really believe it.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/africa/africa-youth-led-uprisings-intl/index.html,"In some of Africa’s major cities, young people are experiencing a summer of discontent as anger and frustration erupt over corruption, the soaring cost of living, and widespread unemployment.
The protests began in Kenyalast month, where young people – particularly Gen Z – engaged in six weeks of demonstrations over an unpopular bill that sought to raise taxes. At least50 people diedas a result.
President William Ruto retracted the bill and announced a shake-up of his cabinet following pressure from demonstrators who remained on the streets, saying they were unhappy about alleged corruption and police brutality in his government. There have been some calls for him to resign.
Kenya, East Africa’s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities, amid a risingunemployment rate among the country’s youth. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenuerepaying its creditors.
The unrest swiftly spread to neighboring Uganda, where citizens attempted to march to the parliament in the capital, Kampala, on July 23 and 25. Security forces responded with a heavy clampdown, detaining more than 100 people, according to police reports.
Those protesting are angry about widespread government corruption in the country, which loses an estimated Sh. 10 trillion ($2.7 billion) in public funding to graft annually,accordingto Ugandan anti-corruption body the Inspectorate of Government (IG).
Radio host Faiza Fabz, who joined the protests, said on social media that the demonstration was an “opportunity to change the course of our nation” and “force the leaders to finally listen to us and demands of the people.”
Some of those demands include “auditing the lifestyle” of MPs “and publicizing it,” and the resignation of lawmakers involved in corruption scandals, according to anewspaper front pageshe shared on social media platform X. Fabz was among the demonstrators detained by the Ugandan police.
Uganda has witnessed some stability in its economy following “an oil-related construction boom and robust growth of agriculture,”accordingto the World Bank.
But it has also grappled with endemic corruption, scoring 26 last year on Transparency International’sCorruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries on a scale of zero to 100, with zero meaning “highly corrupt” and 100 signifying that a country is “very clean.”
Several high-profile Ugandan politicians were sanctioned by theUnited Statesand theUnited Kingdomfor corruption earlier this year, including the speaker of the country’s parliament, Anita Annet Among, whom the protesters called on to resign.
President Yoweri Museveni, 79, who has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for nearly four decades, warned the protesters they were “playing with fire,” and later praised the security forces for “foiling” the protests, andclaimingwithout evidence that they were orchestrated with “funding from foreign sources.”
In Africa’s most populous country, Nigeria, young people are also planning an “end bad governance” march on August 1.
Young Nigerians calling for protests want a respite from the country’s economic woes as inflation skyrockets tomore than 34%, its highest level in nearly 30 years, causing one of the nation’s worst ever cost-of-living crises. Unemployment in the West African nation has also been on the rise, its data office said in its most recentreport, in February.
They also want the country’s security problems curbed amid a rise in kidnappings for ransom, amongother demands, which include “reducing the cost of living, curbing insecurity, reducing the cost of governance, electoral reform, judicial reform, and constitutional reform,” according to a signed statement from a group of civil society organizations.
Human rights lawyer Inibehe Effiong said in aninterviewwith Arise Television on Sunday: “People are tired, people are hungry…. Why does the president have to wait till the 1st of August? He can start this moment to effect the changes that people are asking for.”
The last time a major protest occurred in Nigeria, security forcesopened fire on unarmed protesterswho were peacefully demonstrating against alleged police brutality, resulting in deaths and injuries.
Fearful of a repeat of the 2020 #EndSARS protests, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has called for calm and implored citizens not to take to the streets.

He warned that the planned protest “could degenerate into violence and set the country backwards,” alleging that the upcoming march was being instigated by citizens with dual nationality.
“The sponsors of protests do not love our country … They do not understand citizenship. They have alternative passports. They are in different parts of the world holding meetings virtually,” the presidentsaid.
A Nigerian defense spokesman said the planned protest could replicate deadly demonstrations in Kenya.
“The context of this planned protest is to shadow what is happening in Kenya … and … what is happening in Kenya … is violent … and remains unresolved,” spokesman Edward Bubasaidat a press conference, adding that “the military will not stand by and allow anarchy to befall our nation.”
For Gift Mugano, an adjunct professor of economics at South Africa’s Durban University of Technology, the youth uprisings are “a reality check for African leaders.”
“It’s like a protest contagion because the Kenya Gen Z movement is stimulating the momentum in other African countries,” Mugano told CNN.
He added that “as long as there are no economic opportunities, and governance and rule of law are not at their best, we will not have stability in the continent.”
Mugano advised African governments against cracking down on protesters, telling them to instead “attend to issues affecting the continent, create economic opportunities and improve governance.”
Senegalese political analyst Mamadou Thior echoed this sentiment, telling CNN that the rising dissatisfaction among Africa’s youth could lead to unrest across the continent.
“There is a growing discontent among young people (in Africa) and those who are in charge should pay attention to this movement,” Thior said.
He added that “young people are impatient, and they want things to change at a very rapid pace.”
According to Thior, who leads the Senegalese media ethics organization CORED, youth activists across the continent are connected through social media, “and that’s why what is happening in Kenya can affect people in Uganda and even here in West Africa.”
Youth-led uprisings against corruption and bad governance have also erupted in other parts of Africa, including Senegal and Ghana, in recent months.

Protests broke out in Senegal in February after its then-president Macky Sall announced a delay in the country’s scheduled elections. Following demonstrations that leftat least three protesters dead, Sallbacktracked on the delayafter the Senegalese constitutional council ruled against his decision to postpone the vote.
The ruling coincided with the release of many political detainees, including current PresidentBassirou Diomaye Faye, who was released just a little over a week before the election.
In the preceding months, Ghana, Senegal’s fellow West African state, saw days of anti-government protests as demonstratorsrailed against economic hardships and unemployment.
Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that the continent was on the edge of chaos.
“All over Africa, we are… sitting on a keg of gunpowder,” hesaidin a recent interview with CNN affiliate Citizen TV.
“There’s virtually no exception (country) in Africa where the youth are not angry. They are unemployed… unempowered and they see nothing other than hopelessness,” he said.
Obasanjo warned that “if no adequate attention is paid to the needs of the youth in Africa … it will be very ugly for all of us.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/style/mufasa-barry-jenkins-voice-of-africa-spc/index.html,"Mufasa’s death in Disney’s original “The Lion King” (1994) is, for many children of the ’90s, a traumatic moment in cinema history. When Scar threw his brother off the cliff, his goodbye — “Long live the king” — dripping with sarcasm, audiences were led to believe that, like the helpless young Simba, they had seen the last of the charismatic King of the Pride Lands.
But in the new film “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Mufasa’s story is told from cub to grown lion. The brotherly relationship between Mufasa and Scar — acted in the original in such brilliant counterpoint by James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons — is explained and deepened, while the expanse of the African plains and the elegant movements of the animals are redrawn with modern CGI.
In this film, a prequel to Jon Favreau’s live action remake of 2019, Mufasa (Aaron Pierre) is an orphaned cub who finds a brother in Taka (later to be known as Scar, played by Kelvin Harrison Jr.). Taka and Mufasa both want one thing — the closeness of family in a sometimes ruthless animal kingdom — and set off together on a journey to build a pride of their own.
Directed by Oscar-winner Barry Jenkins (“Moonlight,” “If Beale Street Could Talk”), the latest additionto the franchise follows not only the films but the world-famous stage musical. So significant is “The Lion King”in Western culture, Jenkins told CNN, that it is, “for some people, their first or their primary connection to the continent of Africa.”
Telling a story that contains “the voice of the continent,” said Jenkins, came “with a great deal of responsibility.”
In “Mufasa,”the character of Rafiki most clearly represents that voice — the wise mandrill whose mentorship guides multiple generations of lions in the Pride Lands. He plays the role of storyteller in a film that begins after the events of “The Lion King,” before traveling back in time.
The young Rafiki is played by South African actor Kagiso Lediga, who sees his character as drawing wisdom from across Africa. “Rafiki is a traveler,” said Lediga, “this kind of pan-Africanist guy.”
“As you’re doing it,” Lediga explained, “you go: ‘But is Rafiki Swahili? He comes from Kenya, he’s the Serengeti guy.’ But then, I’m like a Tswana guy who speaks Sepedi, who’s got a bit of Zulu and Xhosa in me.”
John Kani, 81, plays the older Rafiki in the new film. “I’ve always seen Rafiki as the custodian of the culture,” he said, “A historian. Anybody in the village could say, ‘What happened to Scar? What happened to that?’ and everyone would say, ‘Go to the old man Rafiki; he will tell you.’”
Rafiki is growing old in an Africa that is changing rapidly for its real-life human residents, who are increasingly moving to cities. “The challenge of Africa today,” said Kani, “is the absence of grandparents in the raising of the children in the village. Because we move into big cities, we move outside villages, we move to other countries. When the kids go home, they can’t even speak the language of the people, the indigenous languages.Grandparents have to try get an interpreter to tell them of their origin, their story, where they come from.”
It is in telling those stories, and hearing them, Kani said, that one can “stand up tall as an African.”
The multi-lingual Rafiki is typical of Jenkins’ film, with Zulu and Swahili peppering the movie’s dialogue. It is, according to Lediga, due to Jenkins giving him “license” to speak freely and improvise. Kani, too, spoke of the recognition that Jenkins gave him “as a creative spirit.”
“There’s a whole scene in this movie that we made up on the spot,” said Jenkins, “And it only could come out of John Kani telling me about his experiences on the continent. So, I really think being open to the actors driving the process in a certain way, and especially the actors from the African continent — because I do not live there, I do not know the place as well as them … opened up the movie so much.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/us-queen-ghana-tamale-kennedy-johnson-spc/index.html,"Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in February 1996. Twenty-five years later, when Johnson found herself in northern Ghana being made a queen, she couldn’t quite believe where life had led her.
In front of an adoring crowd in Tamale, the largest city in northern Ghana, Johnson was given her honorary title of “Zosimli Naa” in October 2021. It was conferred on her by the Dakpema, Fuseini Bawa, a local spiritual leader, with Zosimli Naa roughly translating as “Friendship Queen” — effectively making her the Dakpema’s head of development in the area.
Thousands of miles from home, riding on a horse and dressed in traditional royal attire, Johnson would have been forgiven for thinking she was in a dream.
“I’m still pinching myself,” Johnson told CNN. “It feels very surreal.”
Johnson’s journey began as a young mother in 1990s Detroit, a time she remembers as “a bit of a challenge.” It’s an understatement. She recalled a relative dropping her off, a pregnant 15-year-old, at the foster home, and promising to pick her up when the child was born. They never returned.
“I had to abandon a lot of my childhood goals,” she said. “I just had to dig deep and find some sort of strength.”
When her daughter D’Kiya was 11, Johnson started taking her on trips abroad — first to the Bahamas, then Hong Kong, then South America. The pair fell in love with seeing the world, and Johnson began documenting her trips online “to show people that minorities can travel.”
“I would meet other people in my age group, but not my demographic,” she said. “I was going places and people would stop me and be like: ‘Beyoncé!’ They would automatically assume I was in the entertainment industry and not taking a holiday, because people of color weren’t really traveling like that.”
Years later, once D’Kiya had left home, Johnson took a DNA test that determined that she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage. For the first time, her travels took her to West Africa. Her arrival there — which she describes as a “return” — “felt like a huge sigh of relief,” she said.
Soon after her first journey, Johnson founded Green Book Travel in 2018, a company that organizes trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Named after the annual travel guide that provided Black people with information to keep them safe in Jim Crow America, Green Book Travel takes people to historically significant locations including sites of deportation in the transatlantic slave trade.
The trips immediately attracted hundreds of people, Johnson said, and her travels to West Africa became more frequent. On one trip, she found herself physically compelled — her “body was on fire” — to visit northern Ghana.
On her second day in the region, she was asked to pay a customary visit to the Dakpema and his elders in Tamale. She quickly realized that this was no ordinary meeting.
“They started consulting amongst each other,” she said, “and then they said ‘we want you to go to prepare to be the Queen.’”
Initially, Johnson did not understand the significance of the offer. But when she recounted the meeting to a village elder, he nearly crashed his car.
Four months later, with her daughter and best friend alongside her, Johnson was “enskinned” in Tamale — officially recognized as FriendshipQueen — before being introduced to the community in a parade at the annual Damba festival, in which she rode on a horse to cheers from the crowd.
“It was overwhelming because the crowd was so big,” said Kendall Jones, Johnson’s best friend who was by her side at the event. “It was my first time ever experiencing having people chase your car down as you’re driving away.”
The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the Dagbon Kingdom, which dates back to the14th centuryand comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in Tamale, where she now lives. So far, together with her charitable foundation Kith and Kin, she has worked to provide clean water, sanitary products, and shoes to the community, and is working on a scheme to support orphans. Locally, she is revered.
“You are put on a pedestal,” she said, “There are all the formalities — the bowing, the ‘Her Royal Majesty,’ making sure that you’re taken care of.”
It’s a difficult adjustment for someone unfamiliar with celebrity. But to Johnson, the role comes naturally. “She represents peace, unity, hope and the connection of our past to the future,” said the Dakpema, who was instantly impressed by Johnson upon her first visit to his palace. “She is very popular within Dagbon and highly respected. The people admire her.”
Kennedy Johnson is not the first Zosimli Naa to be enskinned by the Dakpema. Dr Susan Herlin, an academic from Kentucky, had her title conferred in 1995 and died in 2014. Seven years later, Johnson became the next person to receive the title from the Dakpema Palace.
“We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.”
In November 2024, Johnson was granted full Ghanaian citizenship. In the same month, she was also included in the Most Influential People of African Descent (MIPAD) class of 2024 top 100 futurists and innovators.
“It just unfolded to something beyond my dreams,” she said.
Johnson is especially popular with the young people of Tamale, who call her “The Swagger Queen,” due to her striking fashion sense that makes full use of colorful Ghanaian fabrics.
But no one admires her more than her own daughter, now 28. “It’s the story of a person with everything against them being blessed with everything from the universe,” D’Kiya said. “You can say you’ve seen everything when you’ve seen your mom grow up with a lack of family, and then grow to gain millions of people as her family.”
As daughter of the Zosimli Naa, D’Kiya is now considered a princess. “I remember growing up and thinking, maybe one day I’ll play a Disney princess,” recalled D’Kiya, known by her rapper name Stunna Dior. “It’s still a hard thing to conceptualize.”
And what would the teenage Kennedy Johnson in Detroit think of the current Queen in Tamale? “I think she would feel inspired,” Johnson said. “If the young version met the current me, she would know to keep going and to keep pushing.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/africa/darfur-sudan-crisis-militia/index.html,"“La tasweer! La tasweer!” (“Don’t film! Don’t film!”) the general shouted, his eyes flashing with anger, his jaw clenched as he stormed towards us. A couple of fighters hopped off the back of the militia’s lead truck, fanning out around our vehicle, their rifles drawn.
The second truck that had been following us, tan-colored and laden with a heavy machine gun abruptly pulled over to our side, hemming us in.
There was a moment of panic — were they going to shoot us?
We had come to Darfur to report on the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, never intending to become part of the story.
But months of planning came apart in moments when we were detained by a militia led by the man everyone called the general.
Cameraman Scott McWhinnie handed him the camera, assuring him, “We’re not filming, we’re not filming.” Producer Brent Swails quickly got out of our truck to try to defuse the situation.
“Are we OK? Are we OK?” he asked.
Abruptly, the general turned his back on us and grabbed a rifle from one of his soldiers, before taking aim across the tree-dotted savanna. I was relieved that the gun wasn’t pointed at us but still disturbed by his erratic behavior.
I looked pleadingly at our driver. “What’s going on?” His face was ashen. “I don’t know,” he said.
The general fired off a round. The target appeared to be a bird. He missed.
We had arrived in North Darfur the previous day. The goal was to get to Tawila, a town under the control of SLM-AW, a faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement, led by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, a neutral party in Sudan’s bitter civil war. Tawila is just 32 miles (51 kilometers) southwest of the besieged city of El Fasher which is the frontline of the grisly fight for the Darfur region. As a result, it has become a refuge of sorts for the tens of thousands fleeing the city.
The18-month conflict in Sudanhas been drastically overshadowed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza but the UN fears it could become far deadlier: a cruel confluence of hunger, displacement, and disease with both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the two main warring parties in this conflict, accused of war crimes.
According to the UN, more than 10 million people have been displaced in the violence, almost a quarter of Sudan’s population. More than 26 million people — over three times the population of New York City — face acute hunger.
In particular, all eyes are on Darfur, where a genocide was perpetrated from 2003 to 2005 and where vicious war crimes have heightened fears that the worst could be realized again.
In August,a famine was declared in the Zamzam displaced people’s campin Darfur. And yet, only a handful of international journalists have been able to get in since the start of the war to report on what is happening.
After many months of failing to get permission to visit Darfur from the SAF or the RSF, the invitation from the SLM-AW leadership to visit Tawila seemed the safest way to get in and tell the story.
But when we reached the agreed meeting spot in the town of Abu Gamra, our hosts were nowhere to be found. Instead, a rival militia stood in their place. They had two Toyota Land Cruiser pickup trucks, weighed down with rocket propelled grenades and heavy machine guns.
Our driver was led off in chains to the town jail.
For three hours we were interrogated, one by one, in a small, windowless room. About eight men asked the questions. “Why are you here?” “Who sent you here?” “Who gave you permission to be here?”
We answered their questions but got no information in return: who these men were or what they wanted with us.
When the driver returned later without the chains, there was a brief moment of optimism. Perhaps, we would be escorted to the border and simply instructed not to return.
But the militants bundled us into our vehicle and ordered us to follow them.
Our convoy quickly veered off onto a dirt track, heading deeper into Darfur.
It was at this point that the general suddenly stopped his vehicle and started shouting at us, before shooting his gun. The goal, presumably, to scare us. It worked.
We stopped again, maybe an hour later, by a dry riverbed lined with trees. The youngest fighters laid out a mat and brought out a flask of camel milk for the general and another older man known as the security chief, who wore a turban and sunglasses to hide a missing eye. Trembling, I took off my shoes and sat down in front of them.
“Please, we are very frightened,” I told them in halting Arabic. “I am a mother. I have three little boys.”
The general looked disinterested, but I could see the security chief’s face soften.
“Don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened,” he assured me, “We are human beings.”
The security chief asked us for our partners’ phone numbers, so that he could call them and assure them that we were OK. Grudgingly, I handed him my husband’s number — reluctant to put my family through any stress but conscious that it might also be a way for our captors to check my story. Later, we would find out that an English speaker had called my husband and Scott’s wife from the city of Port Sudan, thousands of miles away from where we were held, to say that we were safe and in good health but threatening that we would be imprisoned for many years if they spoke about it to anyone.
For the next 48 hours, we were held under armed guard by the general, the security chief and roughly a dozen soldiers, some who looked no older than 14. Our detention was spent out in the open, underneath acacia trees. As the only woman, and with no private space to relieve myself, I limited my water and food intake. Sleep, when it came, was a mercy, a reprieve from the clawing sense of panic at not knowing when I would be able to see my children again.
As a journalist, one never wants to become the story. And yet our experience is instructive in understanding the complexities of the conflict in Darfur and the challenges of getting food and aid to those who need it most and getting the story out to the world.
During our journey in and out of North Darfur, we spent many hours traversing the remote region on sandy tracks. We had to dig ourselves out more than 10 times and had a flat tire at least once a day. There are no paved roads in the area, which makes the distribution of aid even more challenging.
But where sturdy trucks with the appropriate tires may help expedite that process, the issue of gaining access to the territory is a much harder problem to solve. The state of North Darfur is the center of some of the heaviest fighting between the RSF and SAF. Swaths of it are under the control of a patchwork of different militias with competing agendas who regularly shift allegiances.  You can have a guarantee of safe passage from one, only to be blocked by another 10 miles down the road.
In August, at US-led talks on Sudan in Geneva, the Sudanese Armed Forcesagreed to allow the flow of aid through Adre, the largest border point between Chad and Darfur. But fewer than 200 trucks have entered in the last two months — a fraction of what is needed on the ground — and only a handful of those have reached the famine-hit Zamzam camp outside El Fasher, where close to half a million people are struggling to survive.
Earlier this month,Doctors Without Borders(MSF) announced it was having to suspend its operations in Zamzam.
photo essayMillions have escaped Sudan’s civil war. But their nightmare isn’t over
“This is a disaster for us. Knowing that we have the team on the ground capable to work and that this suspension is due to either administrative impediments or blockages by the warring parties is, of course, frustrating. We keep trying to push … We cannot abandon these people,” Michel Lacharité, MSF’s Head of Emergency Operations told me.
Compounding the chaos is the difficulty of communications. During our time in North Darfur, we passed at least six cell phone towers but none of them were operational. The pecking order of any group is clearly marked by who is carrying the satellite phone. Our captors confiscated our satellite phone but allowed us to keep our cell phones — confident that they would never work. And they did not. Some of the groups have Starlink satellites that they use to stay in touch. But for most ordinary people, there are few ways to have contact with the outside world.
The net result of these manifold challenges is that NGOs, human rights organizations and journalists have almost no access to North Darfur.
“The world doesn’t see us, the help doesn’t come,” the security chief mused to me one afternoon.
Instead, the most valuable and reliable data we have about the situation on the ground in Darfur comes from satellites.
According to theYale Humanitarian Research Lab,which uses satellite imagery to build up a picture of the situation on the ground, in the first two weeks of October at least 14 villages in Darfur were set ablaze by the RSF, heightening concerns that after a relative lull during the rainy season, the conflict is once again ratcheting up.
But satellite images can only tell part of the story. They don’t allow us to connect, to empathize, to engage.
On our last day in detention, the general and security chief disappeared for about six hours, leaving us in the custody of their young fighters. At one point, several of them told us to remove our bags from our vehicle, saying they were taking our driver to the local market. The four of us looked at each other uneasily. Were they planning to abandon us? Or hand us over to another group? We had no choice but to do what we were told and unload our gear.
Later, when the general and the security chief returned, they were in good spirits.
“It has been decided you will be released tomorrow,” they told us. “We thought you were spies but now you can go home.”
A wave of relief crashed through my body. There were smiles and handshakes with our captors. We posed awkwardly for a photograph at the edge of the mat that had been our makeshift prison.
Our ordeal was over. We were unharmed and soon to return home. The fear and worry quickly replaced by a feeling of bitter disappointment, of failure. We never made it to Tawila. Never managed to talk to the people in Darfur whose lives have been chewed up by this vicious civil war. Untold stories that the world may never hear.

https://edition.cnn.com/style/african-fashion-global-spc/index.html,"In recent years, African designers have found support from international celebrities including Beyoncé, Alicia Keys and Naomi Campbell. Now a growing number of the continent’s fashion brands are preparing to make inroads into global fashion markets.
Among this wave of talent is South African designer Thebe Magugu, who was awarded the 2019 LVMH Prize for young designers, which comes with a €300,000 ($315,000) grant, and opened his first fashion house in Johannesburg last year.
His style combines modern designs with the continent’s cultural identity, an approach he hopes will help African fashion go global.
“I think the world is really hungry for stories that are outside the European gaze or the American view,” he told CNN. “I think the storytelling we have in Africa is so nuanced …when they see it for the first time, they really respond to it.”
He’s not alone in that belief. Serge Carreira, director of the emerging brands initiative at the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the governing body for the French fashion industry, says he has seen an increased appetite for African designers globally.
Carreira says many are intrigued by African fashion because “it represents so many realities, so many expressions, so many cultures that are so different as a whole continent,” and that its designers have found a way to combineculture with contemporary styles.
“I strongly believe that within the next 10 years you will have at least two or three African houses that will be standing as independent houses next to big independent European brands,” he added.
A 2023UNESCO reporton Africa’s fashion sector predicted demand for African haute couture will increase by 42% by 2033, driven partly by the growth of e-commerce. But it found that a lack of funding, infrastructure, and training programs are holding the sector back.
Magugu has experienced this firsthand. He says importing fabric into South Africa means payinga 45% dutyand that a lack of access to capital makes it hard for small businesses.
One way to bolster the industry is forthe continent toutilize its raw materials rather than having to reimport them as processed goods. The report found 37 African countries produce cotton yet the continent imports $23.1 billion of textiles each year, including clothing and footwear
Kenyan designer Katungulu Mwendwa launched her brand Katush in 2014, with sustainability as a key pillar. “We try to create items that are 100% made on the continent,”she said,even down to the buttons which are hand carved in Kenya.
Mwendwa says she often sources cotton from Burkina Faso, Uganda and Tanzania. A portion of that cotton is processed into thread and dyed before being sent to hand weavers in Nairobi to bring her designs to life.
But transporting textiles from across the continent can be expensive, she added, meaning the brand is unable to compete on price with imported garments from China and other major exporters.
Mwendwa wants buyers to see the value in knowing where and how each item was made. “Hopefully (the consumer) keeps it in a way that they want to protect and value,” she said.

Beyond the goodwill of consumers, some say designers need policies that encourage the use of local artisans and materials, especially when it comes to collaborations with more established international brands.
“There needs to be policymaking,” said South African designer Judy Sanderson. “There needs to be a bridge where a big brand could be introduced to all these artisans because artisans mostly don’t have companies, so it’s very easy to exploit them.”
The UNESCO report suggests “creating or improving textile clusters or special economic zones,” that can boost productivity and reduce costs, as well as attract investment by offering tax breaks and streamlined regulations.
It also highlights improving transportation networks for moving raw materials and end products, and suggests African governments could “reduce or limit import tariffs for fashion brands that use traditional African textiles produced on the continent.”
Many designers debut their collections at fashion weeks, which typically bring together buyers, photographers and influencers. The UNESCO report found that about 32 fashion weeks are typically held across the continent each year, noting that they bolster the industry, and that “countries with structured fashion events, such as Nigeria, Morocco and South Africa, have better developed fashion ecosystems.”
Sanderson believes African fashion weeks aren’t yet bringing international buyers to the continent;instead, many African designers must attend international events to forge these connections.
In 2024,a number of African designers launched new collections at the industry’s major fashion weeks. Sanderson, Mwendwa and Magugu were among 20 African designers featured at the 2024 Tranoi Paris trade show last September, where thousands of buyers attended the multi-day event to meet with international designers and discover the latest trends in jewelry, shoes and clothing. The trio alsoattended Tranoi’s first trade show in Asia during the 2024 Rakuten Fashion Week, in Tokyo.
“Fashion does not exist in isolation,” Mwendwa said. “It is so important for my brand and brands like mine to have that global presence. It is so critical even just us as Kenyans to be able to share our work with the continent and with the world and to feel that sense of pride.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/04/world/south-africa-ramaphosa-musk-intl/index.html,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Elon Musk “on issues of misinformation and distortions about South Africa,” the presidency announced on Tuesday.
“In the process, the President reiterated South Africa’s constitutionally embedded values of the respect for the rule of law, justice, fairness and equality,” it said.
The presidency said the pair spoke on Monday, a day after US President Donald Trumpthreatenedto cut off aid to South Africa over the alleged mistreatment of White farmers in the country.
In a blistering post on Truth Social, Trump said he would halt funding until there was a full investigation into allegations that “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.”
Trump said “massive” human rights violations were happening in South Africa “for all to see,” without giving details or providing evidence.

Ramaphosa on Monday denied that South African authorities were “confiscating land” and said his country was looking forward to working with the Trump administration “over our land reform policy.”
Trump’s complaint, which he also made in 2018 during his first term in the White House, refers to South Africa’s complex land reform.
During South Africa’s apartheid era, racist policies forcefully removed Black and non-White South Africans from the land for White use. Since South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, there has been a land redistribution and restitution provision in the country’s constitution.
However, unemployment and poverty remain acute among Black South Africans, who make up around 80% of the population, yet own a fraction of the land.
Last month, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law providing new guidelines for land expropriation, including enabling the government to expropriate land without compensation in certain cases.
Musk, a South African-born billionaire and head of the US’ new Department of Government Efficiency, had previously criticized Ramaphosa’s new policy.
In a post on X, the website he owns, Musk on Monday accused Ramaphosa of having “openly racist ownership laws.”
Ramaphosa had said earlier that, like the United States and other countries, South Africa has “always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.”
Responding to Trump’s aid threat, Ramaphosa said that, other than a major HIV/AIDS relief program, the US did not provide significant funding to South Africa.

https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/chowdeck-nigeria-delivery-spc/index.html,"When Femi Aluko found himself isolating at home during the Covid-19 pandemic one question kept coming to mind — how was he going to get food?
He says he struggled to find quick delivery options in Nigeria’s most populouscity, Lagos, because restaurants were either closed or had incredibly long waiting times. So, he took matters into his own hands and began searching for a solution.
He found his answer while on a trip to Dubai in 2021. Aluko was shocked by the efficiency of food delivery apps there. “It was just so fast,” he said. “I was like, ‘Yes, if this can work in Dubai, it can also work in Nigeria.’ I was going to come back and try it.”
In October 2021, Aluko and his co-founders launchedChowdeck. The on-demand food delivery app enables customers across eight Nigerian cities to order meals from about 2,000 participating restaurants. Aluko says the app has since grown to serve 600,000 customers and works with more than 6,000 delivery drivers.
Areportby McKinsey and Company found the global food delivery market was worth $150 billion in 2021, noting a portion of that rapid growth was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Chowdeck team saw the opportunities within this global industry and wanted to be the homegrown company that led the way in Nigeria.
“I think that we currently still have a lot more demand than supply. Most delivery companies are struggling with heavy demand because they have a lot more people wanting to order food and trends have also shifted since Covid-19,” Aluko said.
Aluko admits the startup struggled to keep up with demand at times. “We scaled too fast … a lot of customers just bombard our platform,” he said, adding that the company is constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency and deliver to its growing consumer base.
In April, Chowdeck received $2.5 million in seed-funding from several investors and the YCombinator startup accelerator. Aluko says this money will go toward optimizing delivery efficiency and expanding to additional cities throughout Nigeria. “The goal of the funding is to ensure that we’re able to provide and grant the best experience to our customers,” he said.
Food delivery apps having beengaining popularityaround the world, with Uber Eats and DoorDash among the most used apps in Europe and the US respectively.

Areportby management consulting firm IMARC found the country’s online food delivery market is expected to grow by more than 10% to reach nearly $2.4 billion in 2032. One necessity to boost business for on-demand delivery apps is internet access. For years, Nigeria has been increasing its internet penetration, with more than 40% of the population now having broadband access, according to theNigeria Communications Commission.
In Africa, several startups includingFoodCourt,Heyfood, andSendMe are vying to become the continent’s top food delivery app. Many are based in Nigeria, one of Africa’s richest countries, and have also been backed by the Y Combinator — which previously backedDoorDash.
Despite the growing competition in his back yard, Aluko and the Chowdeck team believe their company is just “scratching the surface.” Since launching, it has expanded beyond ready-to-eat food delivery by adding options for pharmacy, grocery, andpackage delivery services, in response to customer feedback.
As the company grows, Aluko hopes Chowdeck can one day become a “super app for Africa.” “I see us being the app on everyone’s phone … (so that) from travel to transport, everything that you need to do is available for you on one app,” he said.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/01/health/congo-water-contamination-deaths/index.html,"Authorities investigating the deaths of at least 60 people in northwestern Congo suspect the water source in one of the areas may have been contaminated, the World Health Organization said Friday. But the agency said it’s too early for any definitive conclusion.
Doctors are investigating more than 1,000illnessesthat emerged since late January in five villages in Congo’s Equateur province, where high rates of malaria have complicated efforts to diagnose the cases and where officials have said they’ve been unable so far to confirm the main cause.
WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said during an online briefing Friday that for one of the villages there is “a very strong level of suspicion of a poisoning event related to the poisoning of a water source.”
Ryan did not clarify whether he was referring to contamination by accident, negligence or deliberate action. He also did not identify the village where the poisoning was suspected.
“We will not stop investigating until we are sure that the true cause or the absolute cause of what is occurring here is fully investigated,”Ryan said.
Illnesses were first detected in late January in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours.
Twelve cases and eight deaths in total have been recorded in Boloko, with no new cases recorded since January, officials say, adding that nearly half of deaths there occurred within hours of the onset of symptoms.
The village of Bomate in Basankusu health zone, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Boloko, has been hit the most: 98% of the cases and 86% of deaths have been recorded there, health officials say.
WHO said on Thursday that hundreds of the patients have tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. In addition to common malaria symptoms such as fever and body aches, patients have also shown symptoms like chills, sweating, stiff neck, runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea.
The health crisis has caused fear among residents, some of whom have said they fled the villages to avoid falling sick.
Experts say access to the sick has been hindered by the remote locations of the affected villages and that several people died before medical teams were able to reach them.
“Clearly, at the centre of this, we have some kind of poisoning event,” Ryan said.
Another likely suspect could be a “toxic-type event either from a biological perspective like meningitis or from a chemical exposure,” the WHO emergencies chief said, citing systematic investigations carried out so far by experts.
Officials, though, haven’t been able to confirm the main cause of the illnesses, he said, adding that the high rates of malaria and other common illnesses in the villages are making it difficult to determine the cause.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/mobihealth-africa-telemedicine-intl-cmd/index.html,"As a child growing up in northern Nigeria, Dr. Funmi Adewara experienced a severe hand injury that required multiple surgeries and frequent hospital visits.
These visits exposed her to the harsh realities of the country’s healthcare system. “I remember sitting in overcrowded waiting rooms, watching doctors stretched thin, unable to meet the needs of so many patients,” Adewara recalls.
This formative experience ignited her passion for transforming healthcare in Africa.
Growing up with a mother who worked as a nurse, Adewara’s understanding of healthcare challenges deepened through her mother’s stories.
“I knew early on that healthcare wasn’t a privilege — it was a necessity, and I wanted to be part of changing the system,” she explains.
After training as a physician, Adewara worked for 15 years in the UK’s National Health Service before founding the telemedicine platformMobihealthin 2017.
Since its launch, Mobihealth has impacted thousands of lives, connecting patients with doctors and healthcare professionals across Nigeria and beyond.
The platform has20 integrated telehealth clinicsthat offer remote consultations, diagnostics, and access to specialist care via digital health tools. Located primarily in Nigeria, these clinics are accessible to patients through various subscription plans, and are often financed through partnerships with global donor organizations and private donors.
In addition to the clinics, Mobihealth has partnerships with over 200 hospitals, labs, and pharmacies, Adewara says.
The company has earned global recognition, including a $1 million grant from the US Trade and Development Agency in 2022. Adewara was also one of theWorld Bank’s seven 2020 SDGs & Her award winners,selected from over 2,400 entries worldwide.
Across sub-Saharan Africa, millions struggle to access basic healthcare. According to theWorld Health Organization, the region bears 25% of the global disease burden but has only 3% of the world’s healthcare workers.
“In rural Africa, a trip to the nearest hospital can mean the difference between life and death,” says Adewara.
Mobihealth’s latest initiative offers healthcare for $1 a month for rural and underserved populations. It allows Africans in the diaspora — and global supporters — to sponsor essential services like doctor consultations, diagnostic tests and access to telemedicine clinics. The scheme is not solely based on donations; individuals can also subscribe to the service for themselves.
“Healthcare systems across Africa are under immense pressure,” Adewara explains. “Our initiative is a direct response, using technology to connect rural patients with doctors thousands of miles away.”
For Adewara, Mobihealth’s telemedicine platform is not a temporary fix; it represents the future of healthcare in Africa.
“This is about creating a resilient, sustainable and inclusive system, where people, no matter where they are, can access the care they need,” she says.
“Telemedicine brings doctors to people, wherever they may be. By integrating AI and remote monitoring, we are improving the speed and accuracy of care, saving lives in the process,” she adds.
A number of African companies provide telemedicine services, but researchers have pointed out that there are obstacles that could hinder the growth of telemedicine in the continent. Rural areas can have anunreliable electricity supply and poor internet connectivity, and there is often alack of government policies and fundingaround virtual healthcare.
Adewara envisions scaling her company’s model to reach millions more across Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana, Kenya and Ivory Coast.
“Our work is just beginning,” she says. “We are building a healthcare system for the future — one that is resilient, inclusive and capable of meeting Africa’s growing population’s needs.”
However, partnerships are crucial to achieving this vision. “We can’t do this alone. Our collaborations with the African diaspora, hospitals, governments, and international organizations allow us to reach more people and ensure that healthcare is affordable, efficient and accessible,” Adewara adds.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/03/middleeast/israel-egypt-war-gaza-intl/index.html,"“Are we going to war?” asks a worried Cairo saleswoman upon learning that she’s speaking to a journalist. The ominous question about the prospect of war between Egypt and Israel has crept into many conversations in the country.
These murmurs of war reveal growing concerns among a population worn down by successive economic crises and horrified by the devastation it has seen Israel inflict on Gaza and Lebanon. Over the past few weeks, the diplomatic row over US President Donald Trump’s proposal toforcibly displace Palestiniansfrom Gaza to Egypt has intensified this anxiety, turning this chatter into fervent debate.
Related articleIsrael says it won’t withdraw from Gaza-Egypt border as it sends team to ceasefire talks
The same question, along with alarming answers, has ricocheted through Egyptian, Arab and Israeli media. An Israeli website published an AI-generated scenario of an attack destroying Egypt’s strategic High Dam. And an Egyptian YouTuber posted an AI-generated video of an attack on Israel’s nuclear reactor. Keyboard warriors trade accusations and threats on various social media platforms and TV shows debate what they see as evidence of each side’s readiness for war.
According to a report in Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, this “war sentiment” is fueled by misleading information amplified by right-wing outlets in Israel. Itdebunked many of the claimscirculating on social media and TV about an Egyptian military buildup at the border.
Amos Harel, a defense analyst at Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said he doesn’t know “how much (of) this is coordinated and how much is spontaneous,” but added that it may be in the interest of the Israeli far right to “stir the pot regarding Egypt” to divert attention from domestic criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Families of hostages held in Gaza haveaccusedNetanyahu of wavering on a deal to free the captives in order to appease hardliners in his government, which he has denied. Egypt and other mediators are trying to salvagethe ceasefire, which went into effect in January and is nowhanging by a thread.
The main point of contention is whether Cairo has deployed more soldiers and military equipment to the Sinai than permitted under the security provisions that followed the 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
The treaty, brokered by the United States, ended decades of war between both countries and set limits on Egypt’s military footprint in the Sinai Peninsula that borders Israel. It ushered in an era of close security cooperation between the two, and with the US.
Egypt has been keen to emphasize that it is following the rules. In 2016, while fighting a local ISIS branch, it secured Israel’s approval to expand its military presence in the Sinai. When Egypt reinforced its border with Gaza and bolstered its security last year, Egyptian officials insisted the deployment remained within the framework of a 2016 agreement between the two.
In September, Egypt conducted a military drill in Sinai using live ammunition, followed by a military parade in October that was attended by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi. Media on both sides of the border have aired footage of these events and said they are signs of possible war preparations.
Such alarm hasn’t been confined to the media, as Israeli officials have also chimed in.
“We have (seen) bases being built that can only be used for offensive operations,” Israel’s ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told a meeting of American Jewish leaders in January. He alleged Egypt was in “serious violation” of the peace treaty and that this would be addressed “very emphatically.”
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, reportedly asked why Egypt is spending “hundreds of millions of dollars on military equipment” in an interview with an Israeli radio station. “This should raise alarm bells. We have learned our lesson. We must monitor Egypt closely and prepare for every scenario,” he said.
Egyptian and Israeli military spokespeople did not respond to CNN questions regarding the alleged deployments and whether they would constitute a violation of the security agreements.
Military analysts on both sides dismiss media reports of Egyptian deployments in Sinai as baseless.
“No (Egyptian) tank enters Sinai without Israel’s approval,” said Hossam el-Hamalawy, a Berlin-based Egyptian security analyst, arguing that Egypt’s military doesn’t have the capacity to enter a war with Israel. Most of the videos of Egyptian military deployment and drills circulating in Arab and Israeli media, he explained, are either old or not filmed in Sinai.
In a rare TV interview with the traditionally media-shy military establishment, a leading Egyptian military commander, Maj. Gen. Ahmad Mahmoud Safi El-Din, told Saudi news channel Al-Hadath on Thursday that Egypt’s military expenditure and efforts to modernize its arsenal were meant to “preserve peace and stability in the region.”

Outgoing Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi also addressed the growing concern in a public address last week but said it was not a priority. “We think that it is not a threat at the moment, but it could change in an instant,” he said.
With the absence of a stated government position, the matter was left for influential media personalities to interpret.
“We are not on the verge of a war with Israel,” popular Egyptian talk show host Amr Adib told viewers in February. Known for his close ties to the Egyptian government, he was careful to couch his reassurance, saying it only reflects the current moment, “as in right now, at 10:15 p.m.,” he said, looking at his watch, implying it could quickly change.
Both countries violate the peace treaty, he said, and it would only collapse if one side attacks the other, “but we are not entering war.”
“Israel understands it would be seriously hurt in such confrontation… If we are destined to fight, we are up to it,” he added.
The creeping threat of war has overshadowed domestic issues facing the leaders of both countries. Yet, analysts also point to a series of events that could potentially undermine the treaty.
“Rational minds do not want the treaty to be at risk. The action taken over the past 15 months have put pressure on the treaty that have never been at this level before,” said Nabil Fahmy, former Egyptian foreign minister and dean emeritus of the School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the American University in Cairo.
What could eventually tip the balance is the potential expulsion of Gazans into Egypt, which Fahmy said would constitute a threat to Egypt’s national security.
In themonths leading up to Israel’s operationin the Gazan border city of Rafah, which started in May, Egypt warned that forcing over 1 million Palestinians sheltering there into Egypt, as proposed by some Israeli officials, would put the treaty at risk.
A year ago, Sisi, the Egyptian president, told reporters and his European counterparts that  any such displacement would mean moving the Palestinian fight against Israel to Egyptian territory. “Sinai would become a base for fighting against Israel… In response, Israel would attack Egyptian territory,” he said.
So, when Trump presented his plan to displace Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan and turn Gaza into a Middle Eastern “riviera,” this scenario was already in the back of people’s minds.
“Israelis did not take the Trump plan seriously. But on the Egyptian side, it was taken deadly seriously,” explained Max Rodenbeck, the Israel/Palestine project director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. Fearing that pressure would build up in Washington D.C. for Cairo to comply, Egyptians had to make a show of political force and indicate that the treaty is at risk, he said.

Arab nations didn’t want to directly antagonize the US president by engaging in a media spat. In their rejection of the plan, official statements said they looked forward tocooperation with Trumpto achieve peace in the region. Arab leaders are expected to meet in Cairo this week to discuss acounter planto present to Trump.
Whether Trump backtracks or not, there is a realization among Arab nations that the region,like the rest of the world, is entering uncharted territory under his second term in office.
“Trump’s proposal is in complete contradiction with the whole objective of comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis,” Fahmy said.
Fahmy, like the security experts who spoke with CNN, downplayed the real-life impact of the media chatter about an impending war, but all were worried by its growing intensity.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/08/africa/trump-executive-order-freeze-aid-south-africa-intl/index.html,"US President Donald Trump signedan executive orderFriday aimed at freezing assistance to South Africa over a controversial law that allows the government to seize farmland from ethnic minorities — namely White farmers — without compensation, as well as the country’s stance against Israel and its war in Gaza.
Trump said in the order the United States would no longer support South Africa with foreign aid if such policies, which he claims highlight a “shocking disregard for its citizens” and amount to “human rights violations,” continue, ordering US agencies to stop providing any aid to South Africa unless deemed necessary.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosahas previously deniedthat South African authorities were “confiscating land” and said his country was looking forward to working with the Trump administration “over our land reform policy.”
Trump’s order also directs the United States to assist Afrikaners — an ethnic group descended from European settlers — who are fleeing South Africa due to discrimination, including helping them resettle through refugee programs.
“It is the policy of the United States that, as long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that harm our Nation, the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa; and the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,” read the order.
South Africa’sforeign ministrycalled the order a “great concern” and said it “(lacked) factual accuracy and fails to recognize South Africa’s profound and painful history of colonialism and apartheid,” adding that the move seemed “to be a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation.”
“It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,” the foreign ministry added in a statement Saturday.

In the past, racist policies forcefully removed Black and non-White South Africans from land for White people to use. There has been a land redistribution and restitution provision in the country’s constitution since South Africa emerged from its apartheid era and held its first democratic elections in 1994.
Unemployment and poverty, however, remain acute among Black South Africans, who make up around 80% of the population, yet own a fraction of the land. In January, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law that sets forth new guidelines for land expropriation, including enabling the government to expropriate land without compensation in some cases.
According to the US Foreign Assistancewebsite, the country said it would send nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, including more than $270 million just from the Agency for International Development (USAID).
The executive order comes as the Trump administration has alreadyfrozen almost all foreign assistanceand made moves todismantle USAID.
Trump also said in his order that South Africa had taken an aggressive stance against the United States and its allies through its position on Israel and reinvigorating ties with Iran.
South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in anunprecedented caseat the United Nations’ top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It said Israel’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and called for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.

https://edition.cnn.com/style/tessy-oliseh-amaize-tesslo-fashion-spc/index.html,"She’s the sister of Nigerian soccer legend Sunday Oliseh, but now Tessy Oliseh-Amaize is becoming something of a celebrity in her own right, making a name for herself in the US fashion scene.
As founder of the Tesslo fashion brand, and a former science student, she produces a distinctively modern take on traditionalwax print ankara designs, with her vision inspired as much by mathematics as classic aesthetics.
The style is showcased in her “Africa to the World” collection, featuring designs that infuse elements of African culture in colorfulankara fabrics. Each design takes four to eight weeks to create, using carefully conceived geometric shapes to create an optical illusion of depth, and patterns she describes as “moving in a four-dimensional way.”
“I realized that in designing, the Pythagoras theorem comes to play,” said Oliseh-Amaize, referencing the formula for calculating the relationship between the sides of a triangle. “My designs are all mathematics. You need to think of shapes and even calculate shapes that do not exist.”
“Pyramids” is a knee-length dress made from one of the most common ankara fabrics and inspired by the pyramids of Giza, with prism-like shapes arranged in alternating directions.
“Mpi” is Oliseh-Amaize’s take on a varsity jacket, embellished with rows of protruding cones, a nod to the animal horns used in Nigeria’s traditional Igbo culture for weddings, chieftaincy titles and as a musical instrument.
“For Pyramids, I used geometric calculations, which is a very complex technique in fashion design,” Oliseh-Amaize said, while for Mpi, “I manipulated the fabric in geometrical dimensions to create each one of those horns. I thought that the real beauty of executing this inspiration would be more impactful if I have them all together in a cluster around the outfit.”
Oliseh-Amaize’s design journey started out in the UK, at Middlesex University London, where she studied Fashion Product Management at the start of the millennium. A major break came after she returned to Nigeria and was crowned the country’s best designer at the 2006 Nigerian Fashion Show competition.
She began designing for TV shows, and eventually relocated to the US, which she said “was like starting afresh.” Unlike Nigeria, where there’s a ready demand for ankara clothing, she had to prove her creativity to an American clientele, which meant “taking it to the next level.”
Now based in Washington, DC, her eye-catching designs are increasingly in the spotlight. Last September she was invited to close the Ankara Festival Los Angeles, which celebrates African fashion, and her works were also shown at the Congressional Black Caucus and Philly Fashion Week that month.
After the Ankara Festival, she saidin a statement, “Outside Africa, when people hear “African prints,” it is as if the expectation is that it’s not truly African unless it looks primitive or poorly made. I’m rebelling against that. African fashion is rich, diverse, and deserves to be seen as sophisticated and high-quality.”

It’s a stance that’s earning her celebrity supporters. Folake Olowofoyeku, star of US sitcom “Bob Hearts Abishola,” wore Tesslo’s “Hollywood” dress at the Ankara Festival, a design inspired by old-school Hollywood glamour, with sleeve cuffs shaped like mid-century lamps. Oliseh-Amaize has also received a commission by celebrity stylist J. Bolin for one of his high-profile clients.
As Oliseh-Amaize establishes her own identity, she is stepping out of the shadow of her famous brother, who played for European soccer teams including Ajax and Juventus in 1990s and 2000s, as well as playing for and managing Nigeria’s national team.
Growing up, “Everyone calling me Sunday Oliseh’s sister didn’t mean I had it easy,” she told CNN, saying that she would be overcharged when buying equipment, because people assumed she had money. “I had to work extra hard to get things,” she added.
Now, Oliseh-Amaize is helping younger designers through her “Fashion Professor” project. She has held 35 mentoring sessions on Instagram about everything from understanding different fabrics to knowing how to bill clients, teaching young designers to navigate the industry and to aspire beyond Nigeria.

Her innovations in ankara designs come at a time when more Western designers are exploring the fabric. Oliseh-Amaize says they have the opportunity to do so because they can more easily access funding, which is not always the case for Nigerian designers.
She emphasizes that African designers should not limit their thoughts to designing or selling to only Africans, and Oliseh-Amaize would like to see a time when a Nigerian brand can sell out in international department stores like Harrods or Macy’s.
While her fashion creations are deeply rooted in Africa, Oliseh-Amaize insists that her identity as a designer goes beyond that. “I don’t want to be put in a box and labeled an African designer,” she said. “I want to be identified as a global brand designing for the global market. This is what would make me fulfilled.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/28/africa/violence-erupts-dr-congo-m23-goma-intl/index.html,"A rebel alliance claimed the capture of the biggest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mineral-rich eastern region this week, pushing back against resistance from government troops backed by regional and UN intervention forces.
The takeover of Goma is yet another territorial gain for the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) rebel coalition, which includes the M23 armed group – sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations.
It is also a swift expansion of the alliance’s foothold across swathes of eastern DR Congo – where rare minerals crucial to the production of phones and computers are mined – and is likely to worsen a long-running humanitarian crisis in the region.
“AFC-M23 controls Goma,” Victor Tesongo, an AFCspokesperson, told CNN Monday, adding that “Goma fell under pressure” after the group’s earlier seizure of the nearby towns of Minova and Saké.
The Congolese government has yet to confirm the rebels’ takeover but acknowledges their presence in the city, capital of the eastern North Kivu province. It announced Sunday it had cut diplomatic ties with neighboring Rwanda, which it accuses of equipping the group with both weapons and troops, and recalled its diplomatic staff from the nation. A Rwandan government spokesperson did not deny or confirm the country’s support for M23 when asked by CNN.
More than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as themilitary governorof North Kivu province, have been killed in recent days trying to fend off the rebels, as thousands of locals flee their advance into Goma.
South Africa’s military confirmed Tuesday that four more South African soldiers deployed in DR Congo as part of the UN peacekeeping mission there had died, only days after nine were killed in the fighting.
Meanwhile, aid agencies said that hospitals were overwhelmed as hundreds of people caught in the crossfire in Goma sought treatment for injuries, among them seriously wounded children. Amid the fighting, food assistance programs in and around the city have been temporarily paused, the World Food Programme said Tuesday.
There were “many dead bodies” in the city’s streets, said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office. Fighters had reportedly raped civilians, and property had also been looted, he said. Among those killed was a famed Congolese boxer, Balezi Bagunda, according to Matthew Leutwyler, the founder of the non-profitWe Are Limitless, who had been working with him to evacuate local children the organization works with.
The Red Cross warned on Tuesday that the unrest in the city could lead to the spread of viruses, including Ebola, if laboratories with samples of the disease are affected by the violence.
Patrick Youssef, regional director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said that his organization is “very concerned” that a biomedical laboratory in Goma could be impacted by the disorder there. “It’s a center very close to our delegation,” he said.
Meanwhile, in the national capital, Kinshasa, protesters gathered and fires were lit outside a number of Western and African embassies, including that of Rwanda. The French embassy was “attacked and firebombed,” the French foreign ministry told CNN, but protesters were unable to enter the site’s perimeter.
Later on Tuesday, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advised US citizens to leave the city. “Due to an increase in violence throughout the city of Kinshasa, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advises US citizens to shelter-in-place and then safely depart while commercial options are available,” astatementfrom the embassy said.
Reports emerged Monday of Congolese troopsexchanging firewith Rwandan soldiers along their shared border as fear of a blown-out war grows.
Earlier that day, gunfire rang out from Goma’s airport after it wasshutby the rebels; a French intelligence source told CNN M23 had gained full control of the facility on Tuesday. At the same time,more than 4,000 prisoners broke freefrom a correctional facility, the UN-funded Radio Okapi reported,compounding chaotic scenes witnessed in the city.
In astatementMonday, the Uruguayan army, whose troops are part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Goma, said “hundreds” of Congolese soldiers had laid down their weapons following a48-hour ultimatumby M23.
Rwandan national broadcaster also sharedfootageof Congolese soldiers surrendering their arms to Rwandan forces at a Rwandan border post after fleeing Goma.
DR Congo has experienced decades of militia violence, including armed rebellion by M23, which claims to defend the interest of the minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsi.
Since 2022, M23 has waged a renewed rebellion against the Congolese government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.
For several months, the rebels have also controlled Rubaya, a mining town in North Kivu that harbors one of the world’s largest coltan deposits. This valuable mineral is used in the production of mobile phones.
Bintou Keita, who heads the UN mission in DR Congo, told the Security Council in a September briefing that “competition over exploitation and trade of natural resources” had escalated conflict between armed groups in the country’s east.
According to Keita, coltan trade from the M23-controlled Rubaya mining site is estimated to “supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production”,and “generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue per month to the armed group.”
M23deniedthese claims, insisting its presence in the Rubaya area was “solely humanitarian.”
Areportby the UN Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo, released in December, revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.”
Since April last year, the report said, M23, “with RDF (Rwanda Defence Force) support, has made significant territorial gains and strengthened control over occupied areas,” adding that such a pattern suggested “that the true objective of M23 remained territorial expansion and the long-term occupation and exploitation of conquered territories.”
The report added that the RDF’s military interventions “were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved” by M23.
Goma is home to around two million people and is the largest city in North Kivu. M23’s incursion on Monday was the second time the group hadmoved to capture the provincial capital after it briefly took control in 2012.
M23 spokesman Willy Ngoma told CNN on Saturday that his group was motivated by concern for the residents of Goma, which is home to minority groups such as the Congolese Tutsi community.
“We do not want to capture Goma but to liberate it,” he said. “The population is in distress; we must save it as quickly as possible.”
Prof. Dady Saleh, a Congolese political and economic analyst, told CNN there was more to M23’s interest in Goma.
“Goma is a strategic and highly symbolic city with an international airport, as well as proximity to Rwanda and Lake Kivu, opening the easy path with South Kivu,” he said.
But, most importantly, Saleh said, Goma’s fall to M23 “will be the symbol of its complete and total capture” of the eastern part of the DRC.”
M23’s self-proclaimed liberation agenda has been scarred by a long trail of alleged human rights violations and what rights group Human Rights Watchdescribed in 2023as “war crimes against civilians” in North Kivu. The group has consistently denied such claims.
Fighting between M23, Congolese forces and other rebel groups has also forced many from their homes in the country’s east, with at least 400,000 people displaced just since the beginning of this year in North and South Kivu, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR said in astatement.
UNHCR spokesperson Matt Saltmarsh added that “bombs have fallen” on camps housing those who’ve fled, resulting in civilian deaths, including of children.
This is a huge concern for aid groups operating in the area, such as Mercy Corps. Its country director for DR Congo, Rose Tchwenko, told CNN in a statement that Goma, which she described as a “lifeline of humanitarian operations across eastern DRC” was now “perilously close to breaking.”
“Humanitarian access is nearly impossible, resources are stretched to their limits, and displaced families are left in dire need of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter,” Tchwenko said.
UN experts believe thatan estimated 3,000 Rwandan soldiersoperate alongside M23 fighters in eastern DR Congo, outnumbering the rebel group’s number in the country.
According to Saleh, the Congolese analyst, Rwanda does not just support M23, “it (Rwanda) is the M23.”
Western nations, such as the US, Britain, and France, have censured Kigali’s support for the group.
Rwanda government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told CNN that her country “will do what is necessary to defend our borders and protect Rwandans.”
She cited a UNreportthat found evidence DR Congo’s military had collaborated and carried out joint operations with a Hutu militia groupagainst a mainly Tutsi rebel group, the CNDP, which M23 grew out of.
Hutu militiascarried out the genocide of Tutsisand moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
“This is happening right next to our border,” Makolo said of the insecurity in eastern DR Congo, adding that “the President of the DRC has said publicly that his enemy is President (Paul) Kagame and the Rwandan Government, and that he will ‘liberate’ Rwandans.”
Rwanda’s foreign ministry also blamed DR Congo’s government for failing to engage in dialogue with M23, describing it as a “Congolese rebel group fighting to protect their community in eastern DRC.”
CNN has contacted the Congolese military and government spokesperson for comment on the country’s alleged collaboration with the Hutu militia group and threats against Rwanda.
Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has previouslythreatened to go to war with Rwanda. Rwandan leader Kagame has responded in kind.
“We are ready to fight,” Kagametold French network France 24in June last year, adding: “We are not afraid of anything.”
When the UN Security Council convened on Sunday for an emergency meeting on the crisis, DR Congo’s foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner said Rwanda’s role in the conflict was“a declaration of war that no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.”
Eastern African leaders plan to convene an emergency meeting within 48 hours to find solutions to the crisis, Kenya’s President William Ruto said Monday, urging Tshisekedi and Kagame“to heed the call for peace.”
Previous interventionsled by Angola, includingtruce agreements, have failed to cease hostilities.

“A solution is still in sight,”Saleh told CNN, especially if the leaders meet as planned.
“But it is rather the quality of the solutions in sight that is the real question,” he said.
“The region needs a lasting solution to the security situation, and to achieve this, one of the conditions is that the DRC must be able to ensure its security and control its economy.Solutions in terms of power-sharing, tribal and ethnic integration are not a lasting solution.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/02/africa/south-africa-potential-trump-tariff-intl/index.html,"A contentious law that allows South Africa’s government to expropriate land – without compensation in some cases – has enraged the United States, triggering aid cuts by Washington and outbursts from President Donald Trump.
Many fear that the African nation could now potentially lose some of its US trade privileges as relations between the two countries deteriorate.
South Africa is the largest beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a US trade agreement that provides preferential duty-free access to US markets for eligible Sub-Saharan African nations.
Some US lawmakers want those benefits withdrawn when AGOA is reviewed this year.
In January, South Africa enacted theExpropriation Act, seeking to undo the legacy of apartheid, which created huge disparities in land ownership among its majority Black and minority White population.
Under apartheid, non-White South Africans were forcibly dispossessed from their lands for the benefit of Whites. Today, some three decades after racial segregation officially ended in the country, Black South Africans, who comprise over 80% of the population of 63 million, own only around 4% of private land.
Related articleSouth Africa does have a history of racist land inequality. Just not in the way Trump and Musk are portraying
The expropriation law empowers South Africa’s government to take land and redistribute it – with no obligation to pay compensation in some instances – if the seizure is found to be“just and equitable and in the public interest.”
President Cyril Ramaphosasaidthe legislation would “ensure public access to land in an equitable and just manner.” But the White House disagrees.
Trump and his South African-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk believe that the land reform policy discriminates against White South Africans. Sanctions have since followed.
Responding to a post by Ramaphosa on X about the new legislation, Muskasked: “Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?”
In anexecutive orderissued on February 7, Trumprevoked all aid for South Africa, accusing the country of human rights violations. He also denounced South Africa’s stance against Israel’s war in Gaza, saying the nation undermined US national interests.
The executive order did not specify what aid was being halted but nearly $440 million was committed to South Africa in 2023 – the bulk of which went to its health sector – according to data on the US Foreign Assistancewebsite.
Ramaphosa said in apost on Xbefore the order was issued that, “with the exception of PEPFAR Aid (the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) which constitutes 17% of South Africa’s HIVAids programme, there is no other funding that is received by South Africa from the United States.”
Economist Ndumiso Kubheka told CNN that South Africa could be on the verge of losing its trade benefits with the US under AGOA.
“Based on the changes in trade policy and national interests of the US government, the possibility of changes and South Africa’s exclusion does exist,” he said.
To remain eligible for AGOA, a benefiting nation“must demonstrate respect for rule of law, human rights … (and) should also not seek to undermine US foreign policy interests,” according to requirements outlined on itswebsite.
In aletterto Trump on February 11, US Rep. Andy Ogles and three other Republican congressmen called for South Africa’s duty-free access to the US market to be withdrawn and for diplomatic ties to be suspended, expressing disapproval of its land reforms, its alleged “vendetta against Israel” and its “embrace of China.”
South Africa’s exports arepartly driven by agriculture,whichaccounted for 10%of the country’s total export earnings in 2021, according to the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC). South Africa is the main agricultural exporter under AGOA and its largest beneficiary,according tothe US Department of Agriculture.
In a2023 report, the department said that two-thirds of South Africa’s agricultural exports to the US “are exported tariff-free under AGOA,” with exporters of citrus, wine and fruit juice among the top beneficiaries.
Victor Thindisa, a senior manager for Markets and Economic Research at NAMC, told CNN that removing the nation from AGOA would deal a serious blow to its agricultural industry.
“South Africa is likely to face higher tariffs of about 3% for agricultural exports to the USA should the country be ineligible for AGOA benefits,” he said.
“The loss of preferential market access for the agricultural sector could lead to reduced foreign exchange earnings, decreased competitiveness of South African agricultural products in the USA, and potential job losses,” Thindisa added.

The move might also run counter to the Trump administration’s apparent aims. Stripping South Africa of its AGOA privileges on account of its expropriation law would hurt the same White farmers whom the US seeks to protect, according to Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign minister.
“If you look at the produce that finds its way into the US markets, it primarily comes from our agricultural sector, which is primarily White farmers,” Phiri told CNN.
He added that: “It’s a known fact that most of our commercial farmers are White. They are the ones who are in the majority in the commercial agricultural sector, and they have a commercial gain from an agreement like AGOA. So, the very same people that you believe are being persecuted would be persecuted by such a volatile decision.”
Citrus grower Gerrit van der Merwe, who exports to the US from Citrusdal in the Western Cape province, told CNN that South Africa’s likely exclusion from AGOA would lead to job cuts.
“It would affect us considerably and threaten local jobs,” he said. “It is difficult to estimate precisely to what extent. Citrus is the economic heart of Citrusdal, and any shocks or changes in the industry affect the entire rural community.”
Justin Chadwick, who heads South Africa’s Citrus Growers Association (CGA), said the group was concerned about the situation.
“If AGOA is not renewed, it will create a challenging environment for South African citrus. AGOA ensures our citrus isn’t subject to US tariffs. A US tariff on South African citrus would make our fruit more expensive for American consumers.”
Chadwick told CNN that thousands of rural jobs were at risk.
“To give you an idea of how many jobs are currently connected to US citrus export: an estimated 35,000 local jobs from farm level throughout the supply chain as well as an additional 20,000 jobs in the US are sustained by US-SA citrus exports. Without AGOA, these jobs will surely be under threat.”
At least 100,000 pallets of citrus are shipped to the US from South Africa annually, he said, adding that “South Africa’s entire North American exports make up around 9% of our total citrus exports.”
Outside the Americas region, which accounted for 6% of South Africa’s agricultural exports in 2024, the African continent is the main market for the country’s agricultural goods, making up 42% of its agricultural exports,accordingto the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa (Agbiz).
Other export destinations include Asia and the Middle East, which together totaled 21%, and the European Union, which made up 19% of South Africa’s agricultural exports for 2024, Agbiz data showed.

Despite the comparatively lower trade volume, the US market “matters significantly,” according to Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist at Agbiz.
“Firstly, the exports (to the US) are concentrated in specific industries, mainly nuts, citrus, wines, grapes, and fruit juices. This means while the risks associated with this market are not as significant in proportion to overall agricultural exports, they present challenges to specific industries,” he said.
Secondly, Sihlobo said, “the negative sentiment arising from any confrontation with the Americas region would have negative effects on South Africa’s agriculture.It is, therefore, vital that South Africa maintains positive agricultural relations with this region.”
For the citrus grower Van der Merwe, finding an alternative destination for his produce if South Africa is removed from AGOA and exporting to the US becomes less profitable would not be easy.
“We would still probably export quantities (of) citrus to the US, but given that the usual tariffs would then apply, it would be a big setback,” he said. “South African citrus is valued in other markets like the Middle East and the EU, and switching to those markets if it is more profitable can be considered. But the volume of exports for us to the US is large, it will be difficult for it to be absorbed elsewhere.”
South African leader Ramaphosa said on Thursday he was ready to “do a deal” with the US to repair their plummeting relations.
“We would like to go to the United States to do a deal,” hesaidwhile responding to questions from Richard Gnodde, vice chairman of US bank Goldman Sachs, during a conference in Johannesburg.
“We don’t want to go and explain ourselves,” he added. “We want to go and do a meaningful deal with the United States on a whole range of issues.”
Ramaphosa did not specify what the deal would entail but noted it would span trade, diplomatic and political issues.
“We decided that it’s not best to have a knee-jerk reaction,” Ramaphosa said of Trump’s executive order cutting aid to his nation. “We wanted to let the dust settle.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/11/africa/south-africa-land-aid-freeze-trump-intl/index.html,"The so-called land question has been a decades-long dilemma for South Africa.
Apartheid,dismantled in the 1990s, left a deep-seededlegacy of land inequalityafter centuries of policies pushed non-White South Africans off the land to the benefit of White people. An act in 1913 limited Black ownership to just 7% of the land, later revised to 13%.
Now, more than 100 years later, Black people make up 81% of South Africa’s population of 63 million, yet only own 4% of private land, according to a government land audit conducted in 2017.
A long-debated expropriation act signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month seeks to right some of the wrongs of apartheid by allowing the government to take land and redistribute it.
In some circumstances, expropriation is allowed without compensation, but only where it is “just and equitable and in the public interest.” However, no seizures of private property have taken place.
Emphasizing “the public interest” and that land redistribution cannot be arbitrary, proponents say the legislation is necessary. In many parts of the countryside, vast expanses of land are owned by White farmers, while Black and non-White families have been pushed out into crowded townships, as CNNpreviously reported.
But the controversial law has brought some of South Africa’s long-standing racial tensions and inequalities to the forefront, and now it’s beenseized onby United States President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who claim it discriminates against White farmers.

Musk, born in South Africa and now tasked withslashing US public spending, has accused Ramaphosa’s coalition government, led by the African National Congress (ANC) party, of having “openly racist ownership laws.”
Musk’s stance has been denounced by some White South Africans.
Bloemfontein resident David Van Wyk accused the billionaire of “cozying up to the extreme right-wing in the country,” which he described as “defenders of White privilege.”
Van Wyk, 66, whose family owns mango and maize farms that export overseas, told CNN that Trump was “completely ignorant” about the inequalities in South Africa.
“For Trump to create the impression that White people in South Africa are victims is nonsense. We (White South Africans) have incomes 10 to 20 times higher than the majority of (Black) people in South Africa,” he said, adding that “the majority of South African Black people still own nothing in the country of their ancestors.”
Van Wyk said the Expropriation Act was driven by the need to address land inequalities in the country.
Others, however, argue that the legislation attempts to do so “in a very clumsy manner,” according to Henk Smith, an attorney at a community-based organization, the Land Access Movement of South Africa (LAMOSA).
Smith told CNN that in his view there must be a “just and equitable compensation” for every expropriated land except those reclaimed from mining companies that abuse their licenses, and state-owned enterprises not using their land productively.
In anexecutive orderissued Friday, Trumprevoked all aid for South Africa, saying the purpose was to hit back at their government’s “actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners,” namely White Afrikaners.
He also used the order to condemn the country’sstance against Israeland its war in Gaza.
Trump’s order specified that the US “shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa” through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) or any other executive department or agency.
That means the $440 million that South Africa receives in USassistance- most going to the health sector - was immediately halted.
Trump suspended nearly all US foreign aid on his first day in office, and he has taken steps todismantle USAID, which means that many South African charities, health programs and HIV clinics have already taken a hit.
“We are concerned about the potential impact of the decision by the United States government to suspend some of its funding for HIV and TB (tuberculosis) programs in African countries for 90 days. Now this funding that we get accounts for about 17% of our country’s HIV spend,” Ramaphosa told lawmakers Thursday, before the executive order, when further cuts to aid were only athreat.
“We will not be deterred. We are, as South Africans, a resilient people, and we will not be bullied,” Ramaphosa said.
Days later, he scrambled to send a delegation to Washington to negotiate with the Trump administration before the war of words went any further.
It’s what’s not explicitly stated in the executive order that is worrying many South Africans.
Fears are mounting that the Trump administration could remove the country’s eligibility from the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a trade act that enhances market access to the US for qualifying Sub-Saharan African nations.
Removal from the trade act, which is up for renewal this year, would be a serious blow to South Africa’s agricultural industry, especially citrus farmers, and the automotive industry.
A spokesperson for South Africa’s Department of International Affairs has said that the misrepresentation of the land act “fuels unwarranted fears” about the targeting of White citizens.
AgriSA, a trade organization for South African farmers, has also denounced claims of land seizures as “disinformation.”
“The unexpected signing of the Expropriation Act on 23 January 2025 has sparked political turmoil and unnecessary tension within the agri-food system. This has been exacerbated by disinformation regarding the Act’s intent, impacting negatively on the investment climate for South African agriculture,” AgriSA chief executive Johann Kotzé said.
“To be clear no seizures or confiscations of private property have taken place. Nor has any land been expropriated without compensation. Isolated cases of land grabs and trespassing have been dealt with,” Kotzé added.
Meanwhile, the Solidarity Movement, a network of Afrikaner community institutions that says it represents about 600,000 members, has said it condemns “the many race laws that make us second class citizens,” including the Expropriation Act and is critical of the ANC’s foreign policy. But it doesn’t believe land grabs are taking place.
“We want to put on record the following: We did not accuse the government of large-scale race-based land grabs, or distribute false information in this regard,” the movement said in a statement. “We did not and will not ask for sanctions against South Africa, or that funds for vulnerable people be cut off by the US government.”
Nonetheless, Kallie Kriel, the leader of right-wing lobbying group AfriForum, which is part of the Solidarity Movement, said that Trump was correct to claim certain sectors of South African society are being treated “very badly.” “I think that is true even though people might deny it,” Kriel told Reuters.
For years, AfriForum has claimed, against evidence, that there is possible ethnic cleansing and a “large-scale killing” of White farmers. Their interview with Fox News attracted atweet from Trump in 2018, when he first weighed in on the issue.

The first mass grave with 19 bodies was found Friday in a farm in the southeastern city of Kufra, the security directorate said in a statement, adding that authorities took them for autopsy.
Authorities posted images on its Facebook page showing police officers and medics digging in the sand and recovering dead bodies that were wrapped in blankets.
The al-Abreen charity, which helps migrants in eastern and southern Libya, said that some were apparently shot and killed before being buried in the mass grave.
A separate mass grave with at least 30 bodies was also found in Kufra after raiding a human trafficking center, according to Mohamed al-Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra. Survivors said nearly 70 people were buried in the grave, he added. Authorities were still searching the area.
Migrants’ mass graves are not uncommon in Libya. Last year, authorities unearthed the bodies ofat least 65 migrantsin the Shuayrif region, 350 kilometers (220 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli.
Libya is the dominant transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to make it to Europe. The country plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Oil-rich Libya has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of militias and foreign governments.
Human traffickers have benefited from more than a decade of instability, smuggling migrants across the country’s borders with six nations, including Chad, Niger, Sudan Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia.
Once at the coast, traffickers pack desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe into ill-equipped rubber boats and other vessels for risky voyages on the perilous Central Mediterranean Sea route.
Rights groups and U.N. agencies have for years documented systematic abuse of migrants in Libya including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats.
Those who have been intercepted and returned to Libya — including women and children — are held in government-run detention centers where they also suffer from abuse, including torture, rape and extortion, according to rights groups and UN experts.",africa

“Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,” Trump said, drawing laughs in the Congress.
Lesotho’s foreign minister, Lejone Mpotjoane, said the remark was “quite insulting.”
“I’m really shocked that my country can be referred to like that by the head of state,” he told Reuters.

Trump’s administration has cut billions of dollars in foreign aid worldwide as it seeks to align spending with Trump’s “America First” policy.
Mpotjoane said Lesotho was feeling the impact as the health sector had been reliant on that aid for some time, but that the government was looking at how to become more self-sufficient.

https://edition.cnn.com/style/africa-hall-redevelopment-ethiopia-spc/index.html,"Only 26 African countries had achieved independence when, in February 1961, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie ascended a sloping staircase to inaugurate Africa Hall in Addis Ababa, which he gifted as the new headquarters for the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
A dominating presence in the heart of the Ethiopian capital, adorned with a sweeping 150-square-meter (1,614-square-foot) stained-glass window, the structure, designed by Italian architect Arturo Mezzedimi, had taken just 18 months to build. Fittingly then, it didn’t take long before the building became the site of a landmark event in the story of modern Africa.
Just over two years later, Selassie once again made the climb to welcome the founding members of the newly formed Organization of African Unity (OAU) to their home — a meeting place intended to foster cooperation, drive economic progress and eradicate colonialism across the continent.
Addressing representatives of the then-32 independent African states, Selassie declared that the continent was “at midcourse, in transition from the Africa of yesterday to the Africa of tomorrow.”
“We must act to shape and mold the future and leave our imprint on events as they slip past into history,” he continued.
More than 60 years later, Selassie’s message has come full-circle: Africa Hall has been shaped and molded anew.
Last October marked the completion of a decade-long renovation across the entirety of the 12,800 square-meter site, commissioned by the ECA in 2013 with a $57 million budget to revitalize the landmark as a world-class conference and cultural venue.
Australian design practiceArchitectus Conrad Gargettwas entrusted with leading the re-design, giving project architect Simon Boundy a mission with dual themes — modernization and conservation.
“The two go hand-in-hand with projects like this,” Boundy told CNN, “Where you’ve got an aging asset, but if it doesn’t get used, it falls into disrepair.”
“It’s about bringing the building back to life, making it accessible to the public and celebrating the story of the building for future generations.”
The conundrum for Boundy and his team was that those two aims threatened to undermine the historical significance of Africa Hall. In essence, how do you modernize a historical landmark without losing some of its soul?
As a heritage architect — regularly tasked with making sensitive changes to buildings of historical or cultural importance — Boundy is well-versed in answering that question.
The first step was understanding Africa Hall’s importance and history, which was aidedby hiring local architects and engineers to work on the renovation. Among them was Mewded Wolde, who, a day before her university graduation in 2014, found herself on the roof of Africa Hall taking measurements.
Born and raised in Addis Ababa, Wolde says the building — which hosted OAU meetings until the organization was replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002, which eventually moved into new headquarters in Addis Ababa — is a source of pride for herself and many others given its role in helping countries across the continent achieve independence from colonial rule.
“This building, still for the African Union, is a symbol,” Wolde told CNN.
“It’s an artwork in itself that symbolizes the struggle that we have gone through in the past 60, 70 years to get to African unity.”
Local knowledge helped Boundy navigate the “balancing act” of modernizing Africa Hall without devaluing its legacy. Roughly 13 million new tiles were fabricated and reinstalled to exactly match the original material, staying true to the brown, orange and off-white color palette of Mezzedimi’s modernist design.

The old layout of the Plenary Hall was deemed to lack seating space, so after consulting the building’s original architectural drawings, the team designed new furniture in the same style and added an extra ring of seating.
Hidden in each desk is a digital screen, a subtle addition that — along with the arrival of a 13-meter-wide (42-foot-wide) LED display — leaves Africa Hall well suited to meet the technological requirements of modern conference hosting, while preserving the original architecture.
“We don’t want to leave our mark on the building,” Boundy said. “We want to just bring the original design to life again and hopefully everything that we do is behind the scenes, concealed in the ceilings, and it’s not the feature.”
Some aspects, however, demanded more radical change, especially those concerning accessibility and safety. The building — “quite dilapidated” — was stripped back to its structural core and strengthened with carbon fiber and steel before being built up again, Boundy explained, to protect the concrete from the damage caused by rusting steel and the threat of seismic activity.
Protective measures also included a strengthened frame for the crown jewel of Africa Hall: the two-story stained-glass window that has adorned the foyer since 1961.
Titled “The Total Liberation of Africa,” it was Ethiopian artist Afewerk Tekle’s signature piece and is split into three panels; Africa Then, Africa Then and Now, and Africa Now and in the Future.
Featuring a knight in shining armor emblazoned with the UN logo, a dragon and the grim reaper, the work tells a story of liberation, of “slaying the demons” of colonization, Boundy explained.
Tekle’s work is Africa Hall’s definitive symbol, and can be seen splashed across shirts, ties and more in the city.
“The symbolism of the artwork is something that’s really hard to overstate, how important that is,” Boundy said.
“It really tells the story of what Africa Hall is trying to represent, which is the very best of what Africa can do, quite literally shedding the recent history, and looking very much forward … You can sit and spend hours staring at it.”
With various original pieces either loose or missing, the entire artwork was meticulously disassembled, cleaned and restored panel-by-panel by Emmanuel Thomas, the grandson of the person who originally made the stained glass from Tekle’s design.
Its refreshed look was unveiled alongside a new permanent exhibition to highlight the key events at Africa Hall that have helped to shape Pan-African history. For Wolde, both the artwork and the renovation itself are reflective of Selassie’s 1963 address, where he spoke of molding the Africa of tomorrow.
“Even now, even with all the upgrades that have happened in Africa Hall, this quote is actually true,” Wolde said.
“This is the space that we’re going to use to shape the future. Even then it was where they were having meetings … to shape the future of Africa, and even now, it symbolizes that. I really love this.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/africa/russia-expanding-influence-in-africa-intl-cmd/index.html,"While Russian ally Bashar al-Assad was being toppled by rebels in Syria, another friend of Moscow, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, was being chaperoned by Kremlin-backed mercenaries in the conflict-ridden Central African Republic (CAR), where armed groups are yearning to oust him.
“Without the protection of Wagner (a private Russian military force), he (Touadéra) could not be president at this time,” Aboubakar Siddick, spokesperson for an alliance of rebel groups in CAR, known as the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC-F), told CNN.
Siddick said that the CPC-F rebels were feeling “inspired” by Assad’s ouster, stating: “Touadéra’s dismissal is imperative.”
In a sign of the importance Russia places in its relationships in Africa, Vladimir Putin met Thursday with Touadéra in Moscow, in what were the Russian president’s first international talks this year.

“This is connected to the fact that we are developing relations with the Central African Republic in all possible areas, including highly sensitive areas related to security. And we intend to develop this cooperation further,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov ahead of the meeting.
Decades of conflict in CAR mirror the instability in other fragile African states where reliance on Russia’s military offerings has become increasingly prevalent, amid an aggressive push by Moscow to lessen Western influence on the continent.
As Russia’s foothold in Africa expands – notably in the mineral-rich Sahel region that is beset by recurring coups, armed rebellion and extremist insurgency – anti-Western sentiments, partly fueled by Russian propaganda, are engineering the exit of Western troops from swathes of territory. The Kremlin is the most favored to fill the vacuum they leave.
Ivory Coast and Chad are the latest in a string of former French colonies in West and Central Africa to demand the withdrawal of French andother Western forcesfrom their territories, treading in the path of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Those three, all now controlled by juntas, have sinceturned to Russia for security support, ignoring calls from their Western ex-partners for a swift return to civilian rule.
Moscow is also a sought-after partner by non-French former colonies such as Equatorial Guinea, which hosts an estimated200 military instructorsdeployed by Russia in November to protect the Central African nation’s presidency. Its authoritarian leader President Teodoro Obiang, 82, has ruled the tiny, oil-rich country for 45 years following a coup in 1979.
Outside West and Central Africa, Russia is bolstering its presence in the continent’s north, where Wagner forcesback eastern Libya’s de facto ruler, Gen. Khalifa Haftar.
Following Assad’s ouster as Syrian leader last month, Moscow has operated multiple flights to and from an airbase in eastern Libya — some headed to Mali,CNN found— suggesting a shift from the Syrian bases that have served as a hub for its military operations in Africa and the Mediterranean region.
In CAR, an erstwhile French colony, the Russian mercenaries that have operated in the country since 2018 have become the dominant force, following the finalexit of French troops in 2022.
At Thursday’s meeting with Putin, Touadéra thanked the Russian leader for supporting his nation and helping it to achieve stability.
“Today, the army trained by Russian instructors is capable of repelling terrorists and anyone who encroaches on the territory of CAR. We will continue to work together to strengthen security throughout the country, at the borders, wherever the threat comes from. Russian instructors are truly professionals,” he said.
The French — who deployed to CAR to help stabilize the nation after a coup in 2013 sparked a civil war — retreated over what the armed forces ministry said was CAR’s failure to halt“massive disinformation campaigns”targeting France amid a competition with Russia for influence.

French President Emmanuel Macron last weekslammed African leadersfor showing “ingratitude” over the deployment of his nation’s troops in the Sahel, saying that Sahel states only remained sovereign because of the arrival of French forces.
Macron also dismissed the notion that French troops had been expelled from the region, adding that France was only “reorganizing itself” on the continent. “We left because there were coups d’état… France no longer had a place there because we are not the auxiliaries of putschists.”
A US State Department report published last February outlined how Kremlin-funded disinformation hadtaken rootacross Africa with the creation of a pro-Russia news agency called the“African Initiative”— which, with the help of hired local journalists, markets Moscow to the continent while tarnishing the West’s reputation.
CAR’s army, bolstered by Russia’s Wagner mercenaries, United Nations forces and Rwandan troops, has battled to keep armed groups such as the CPC-F at bay and reclaim territory seized by rebels. But it is the Russians who are widely credited with helping the nation stave off collapse.
Statues honoring the late Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and top commander, Dmitry Utkin, were unveiled in CAR’s capital, Bangui, in December, a Telegramchannellinked to the mercenary group reported. Both men werekilled in a plane crashnorthwest of Moscow in August 2023, two months after they hadlaunched an abortive rebellionagainst Russia’s military leadership.
Wagner, rebranded as the Africa Corps and placed under the umbrella of the Russian defense ministry after Prigozhin’s death, still operates under the Wagner brand in CAR, where its mercenaries are possibly the group’s most active in Africa.
CAR’s communications minister, Maxime Balalou, told CNN the statues were “inaugurated as part of the cooperation between our country and Russia,” adding that a bilateral defense agreement “allowed Russia to provide us with weapons” as well as “handling and training for our defense and security forces, (and) assisting our armed forces on the ground.”
Anothermonument, depicting Wagner troops guarding a local woman and her children, was erected in Bangui three years ago.
“Russia’s significant contribution helped stabilize and secure CAR,” Balalou said, adding that “at the height of CAR’s crisis, we were abandoned… but Russia responded.”
Not everyone views Russia’s involvement in Africa through a positive lens.
The Kremlin’s guns-for-hire mission is far from humanitarian, according to Irina Filatova, a Russian historian specializing in African history. It’s a mixed quest for power and cash, she said, as Moscow hunts for alternative revenue to sustain its war in Ukraine amid a raft of Western sanctions.
“The Russians are providing this support (to troubled African nations) in exchange for either the full control or a percentage of the control from their mineral resources. That is what Russia needs: It needs funding, and it needs influence. It helps its war in Ukraine,” Filatova, a senior research associate at the University of Cape Town, told CNN from South Africa.
In CAR, Martin Ziguélé, a former prime minister and current opposition MP, told CNN that Wagner’s remuneration for providing military services to his nation “is done in an extremely hidden and discreet manner” by the Touadéra-led government.
Previous CNN investigationsfoundthat companies linked to ex-Wagner leader Prigozhin had won concessions to mine gold and diamonds in CAR, where nearly 70% of the population lives in extreme poverty — the fifth highestpoverty ratein the world, according to a World Bank assessment in 2023.
One of those companies owns rights to the Ndassima gold mine, located 440 kilometers (273 miles) east of Bangui, whose gold proceeds are valued at over $1 billion,accordingto the US Treasury Department.
“Authorities have no right of inspection,” Jean-Fernand Koena, who heads a union of CAR’s journalists, told CNN about what he said was Wagner’s total control of the Ndassima mine.
CAR’s government, he said, cannot monitor “where the gold that they (Prigozhin-linked company) mine goes,” adding that there is “neither public accounting nor information from the ministry of mines.”
CNN has contacted the mines ministry for comment.
The US Treasury Department said in astatementannouncing sanctions in June 2023 that the company, Midas Ressources, had “in conjunction with the Wagner Group” denied “CAR government officials the ability to inspect the Ndassima mine.”
The same statement said another company affiliated with Prigozhin, named as Diamville,  had “shipped diamonds mined in the CAR to buyers in the UAE and Europe.”
The Treasury  further reported that in 2022 (the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine), two companies – Diamville and Industrial Resources – took part in a gold-selling scheme to convert CAR-origin gold into US dollars and that the latter knowingly “participated in the transfer by hand of cash to Russia”  — in a bid to bypass US sanctions on Russian financial institutions.
Areportby the World Gold Council, an international association of gold producers, puts Wagner’s earnings from its illicit gold dealings at an estimated $2.5 billion since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
“This includes the profits from mines and refineries under Russian control, as well as retainers for security services, in CAR, Sudan and Mali,” the report said.
In 2022, CNN also investigatedRussia’s plunder of Sudan’s gold, uncovering more than a dozen Russian gold-smuggling flights out of the war-torn country in exchange for backing its military leadership.
The following year, CNNuncoveredevidence that Wagner had been arming a Sudanese militia group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is engaged in a bitter war with Sudan’s armed forces for control of the country. Both Prigozhin and the RSF denied this at the time.
For CAR, the murky underbelly of its military partnership with Russia also comes “at the cost of serious violations of human rights,” Koena said.
Wagner’s alleged atrocities in Africa are widely reported. In CAR, its forces were found to have “summarily executed, tortured, and beaten civilians” since 2019, according to a 2022reportby the rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Balalou, the communications minister, did not address these allegations but told CNN: “We are developing a new form of win-win cooperation with Russia.” He didn’t specify what this entailed.
Vladislav Ilin, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in CAR, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Outside CAR, similar atrocities, including the killing of civilians, have been committed by Wagner, the HRW claimed in anotherreportlast year, this time uncovering the group’s alleged deadly activities in Mali, where it partners with the West African nation’s military to fight insurgents.
Wagner has suffered some of its worst losses on the continentin Mali.
In response to a question from CNN about the nature and scope of Russia’s military partnerships on the continent, the Kremlin’s Peskov said: “We are purposefully developing our cooperation with African countries, including interaction in sensitive areas related to security.”
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment on the widespread allegations of abuse and misconduct attributed to Wagner forces in CAR and Mali.
The Kremlin isn’t the only foreign power jostling for influence in Africa.
With the US largely focused on the Middle East, China has made deep inroads into the continent over decades,expanding military tiesand claiming the title of Africa’s top trading partner for the past 15 years,accordingto Beijing.

China has also financedtens of billionsworth of development projects across Africa, including under its flagshipBelt and Road global infrastructure drivelaunched in 2013.
Projects under the initiative’s umbrella have generated accusations of lax environmental and labor standards, as well as risky lending, with critics saying China has saddled low- and middle-income governments with overly high levels of debt relative to their GDPs. Beijing has sought to push back on Western criticism over those debts.
Mutasim Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Canadian NGO, told CNN that in his view, Russia and China tend to share a common trait in their dealings with Africa.
“Russians and Chinese do not care about democracy, human rights violations, corruption, and the like… They’re happy to protect dictators and human rights violators. That’s one of the reasons why Russians are getting a lot more influence,” he said, contrasting their approach with Western powers such as the US and France, who prioritize democracy and human rights protections.
Areportby the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies in 2022 highlighted concerns over abusive labor practices, unsafe working conditions and lack of transparency among Chinese-owned companies operating in southern Africa.

A Chineseforeign ministry statementissued after the summit said Beijing was committed to building a “shared future” with Africa and that “China will continue to respect African countries’ political and economic choices based on their own national conditions and honor the principles of noninterference in African countries’ internal affairs.”
In Koena’s view, China’s policy of non-interference speaks to how different powers operate in Africa, with China focusing on economics and Russia on security.
“In a renewed resentment against Western policy in Africa, China is imposing itself on the economic level through trade and infrastructure while Russia wants to be the military response for the stability of sometimes autocratic regimes,” he said.
For Koena’s country, CAR, which has experienced decades of instability, “the message of peace and security gets across more quickly than the economy,” he added. For as long as this continues, the Russian military presence will likely be welcomed by its leaders.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/15/africa/south-africa-white-trump-supporters-demonstrate-int-latam/index.html,"Some white South Africans showed support forPresident Donald Trumpon Saturday and gathered at the US Embassy in Pretoriato claim they are victims of racismby their own government.
Hundreds of protesters held placards that read “Thank God for President Trump” and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority.
Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa’s Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land.
The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump’s claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions.
Related articleSouth Africa does have a history of racist land inequality. Just not in the way Trump and Musk are portraying
Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as “racially disfavored landowners” — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the US. They are only one part of South Africa’s white minority.
In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under theapartheid system of white minority ruleand hundreds of years of colonialism before that.
“The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,” Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good.
The Trump administration’s criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority.
﻿According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country’s population.
White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people.
Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk— who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-White for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria.
While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/caviar-madagascar-luxury-spc/index.html,"When Delphyne Dabezies first announced her plans to launch Africa’s first caviar manufacturer, some in the luxury food industry were incredulous.
But now, 15 years since founding her company, Acipenser, with its Rova and Kasnodar Caviar brands, Dabezies’ products have made their way into some of the most prestigious kitchens in the world.
High in the mountains of Madagascar, just east of the capital Antananarivo, Lake Mantasoa has emerged as an unlikely source of this opulent ingredient. “Every expert was saying it was impossible,” Dabezies told CNN.
Caviar is a delicacy made from the salted eggs of sturgeon fish. Traditionally sourced from Russia’s Caspian Sea, it gained luxury status in the 17th century after Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich I made caviar a state monopoly.
Production soon spread around the world. With the establishment of Acipenser in Madagascar, caviar is now produced on every inhabited continent other than Australia.
Due both to its cultural significance and the long maturation period of sturgeon fish – between eight and 20 years – caviar can fetch﻿ prices as high as $27,000 a teaspoon.
And then there is the coveted taste. “You just sort of press it against your palate,” Nichola Fletcher, author of “Caviar: A Global History,” told CNN, “and the little eggs dissolve into deliciousness.”
Inspired by a television program on sturgeon farming in France, French trio Dabezies, her husband Christophe, and their friend Alexandre Guerrier, decided to pursue a similar project in their adopted home of Madagascar, where they were already working in the textile trade.
Dabezies said they began “without any knowledge” of caviar production.
“Nobody in the beginning though it was possible, and nobody wanted to help us,” Dabezies said. It took the arrival of a retired sturgeon farming expert Francoise Rennes, on vacation in Madagascar, to help them get their project of the ground. And then one day, driving to their weekend house, they saw the lake.
Lake Mantasoa is situated at an altitude of approximately 1,400 meters (4,590 feet) in the Madagascan highlands, a temperate zone atypical for the tropics. It turned out to be “absolutely the perfect environment to grow the sturgeon,” said Dabezies. Unlike in the Northern Hemisphere where low water temperatures can cause the fish to stop growing, Lake Mantasoa ranges between 13 and 23 degrees Celsius, allowing the fish to grow year-round. Consequently, Dabezies’s fish mature around two years faster.
Soon, the dream of three novice sturgeon farmers became a reality. Today, their caviar production comprises both land and lake-based ponds in Madagascar, farming six species of sturgeon.
The culinary world was wary when Acipenser produced the first batch of its premium Rova Caviar, named after the historical Madagascan Queen’s Palace in Antananarivo, in 2017. Madagascar is known for its vanilla, not its fish eggs.
“At the beginning it was difficult,” said Dabezies. “Everyone was laughing – it was a joke. But the only way to prove that the caviar is excellent is to taste it.”
The opportunity arrived when Europe’s top chefs sampled the produce at the prestigious culinary expo Sirha Lyon in 2019. Since then, Rova Caivar has appeared on high-end menus around the world, including the five-star Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz.
“Here we have a caviar that is full of indulgence,” said Julia Sedefjian, who was the youngest ever chef to run a Michelin-starred kitchen in France, and who created a dish with Rova Caviar for last December’s La Grande Tablée in Paris, a gala dinner presented by nonprofit La Tablée des Chefs. “A caviar that could suit all palates, (with a) buttery, brioche-like and hazelnut flavor on the finish.”
The caviar has proved popular in Africa, too; Le Saint-Gerán Hotel in Mauritius, and the Constance Lemuria and Constance Ephelia in the Seychelles have all served it.
“For chefs now, it’s a selling point to have caviar from Madagascar on the plate,” Dabezies argued.
Rova’s most expensive product sells for €11,670 (around $11,960) per kilogram.
Madagascar is one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth and is home to thousands of species found nowhere else in the world. Dabezies, along with Christophe and Guerrier, has lived there for nearly 30 years.
“It’s given us a lot,” she said, and so “the most important thing is that the business provides a profit to local people and to the country.”
Acipenser employs around 300 people, 80% of whom are from the local municipality of Ambatolaona. The company provides training in fish farming and caviar production, and offers medical coverage, literacy courses and family planning education.
It has recently been granted a lease by the government that will allow it to re-forest and protect 200 hectares of hills around Lake Mantasoa.
Acipenser says it is taking steps to ensure the lake’s sustainability, including by restocking it to support local fisheries, installing a water monitoring system, and facilities to prevent water pollution.
The ultimate goal for many caviar makers is to produce Beluga caviar, the most expensive and luxurious form of caviar, made from the Beluga sturgeon, the species that takes the longest to mature and that produces the biggest eggs.
As of last year, Acipenser had its first Beluga fish in Madagascar. This year, it is aiming to produce Beluga caviar for the first time.
“Madagascar is a unique place with incredible potential,” Dabezies said, “We are proud to be a part of its story and to share its treasures with the world.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/yemi-alade-interview-grammys-spc/index.html,"Nigerian Afro-pop sensation Yemi Alade has history with the Grammys. She’s featured on a Grammy-nominated album by Beyoncé and a Grammy-winning one by Beninese-French star Angelique Kidjo; but despite her popularity in Africa and her multilingual songs, Alade has yet to win a solo Grammy.
On February 2, that could change, with her song “Tomorrow” nominated in the Best African Music Performance category.
For Alade, her latest nomination is particularly special. “This time around it was for my own song, it was for my own crown,” she told CNN.
A post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica)
“Tomorrow” features on Alade’s sixth studio album “Rebel Queen,” which theRecording Academy said “solidifies her reputation as “Mama Africa”—the title of a previous Alade album and a term associated with iconic South African singer Miriam Makeba.
Alade first found fame with her 2014 single “Johnny,” which in 2019 made her the first Nigerian female artist to hit100 million viewson YouTube. She has also recorded the song in Portuguese, Swahili, and French.
She was inspired to record the French version by hearing her francophone African fans singing it word for word at her shows and thought that would show them her appreciation. As she began to tour Europe, she recalls the song became one of the pillars of her career.
“Paris is one of the cities that opened its borders to my music, and I fell in love with French even more,” Alade told CNN. “I wanted to communicate, so I decided to make versions of my songs (in other languages). That’s how the love story with languages started off.”
Alade was born in Abia State, southeastern Nigeria, to a Yoruba father and an Igbo mother, and historically, “intertribal relationships were frowned on,” she explained. As a teen growing up in Lagos, she and her friends were also immersed in African American culture listening to rap music and making mix tapes. That context played a key role in Alade’s development as an artist and intentionality became paramount, from her lyrics to her album titles.
“King of Queens,” “Woman of Steel,” “Mama Africa,” “Empress”, and “Rebel Queen” all speak of her struggles as a female artist in the industry, women’s empowerment and the unification of Africans across the world.
“I needed to be my own superwoman. I think that spirit became what you see today,” she said.
Rebel Queen mixes genres like R&B and pop with dancehall, highlife, and amapiano, with Alade singing in English, French, Igbo, Yoruba, and Swahili. It is the climax of a decade-long musical career that has taken her on a rich cultural journey.
“My love for Africa just genuinely grows,” she said. “I do not do this with an agenda. When I travel, I see the different cultures, I easily accept it, appreciate it, from the food to the language to the way of life. In every country I go to there’s something that’s culturally appealing.”
Alade has become known as a champion of African culture and for her international collaborations. Shefeatured in Beyoncé’s2020 musical film and visual album “Black is King,” and on her song “Don’t Jealous Me” from the album “The Lion King: The Gift.”
A post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica)
New album “Rebel Queen” features Ziggy Marley on the song “Peace and Love” and Kidjo on “African Woman.” The latter, Alade says, was one of the most challenging and fulfilling songs to make because she got to know one of her heroes even better, describing Kidjo as “my musical mother.”
Despite her growing success, Alade has chosen to remain independent, working with the same management team for over a decade in the music industry and recording with Effyzzie Music Group, rather than a major label.
“Other labels have made offers and we haven’t accepted, not because they’re not good enough. (But) if your goals are not in alignment with the goals that I’ve set for myself for over 10 years, then we should not be in the same boat. If you have a team of two people, trust me, that’s all you need,” she added.",africa

Eastern Cape provincial police said in a statement it was investigating the death of Muhsin Hendricks, 58, in Bethelsdorp stating that the motive behind the killing was unclear.
The statement said that at around 10 a.m. Saturday, “Hendricks and a driver was inside a gold-colored VW TRoc in Haley Place, Extension 24, Bethelsdorp when a silver-colored Hilux double cab stopped in front and blocked them from driving off.”
It added that: “Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle. Thereafter they fled the scene, and the driver noticed that Hendricks who was seated at the back of the vehicle was shot and killed.”
Avideo, captured by a security camera, purporting to show the shooting incident has been shared widely on social media. CNN has not independently verified the video, and police said they could not confirm the video as an investigation is underway.
Shootings are common in South Africa wheremurder rates– already among the highest in the world – are at a 20-year high.
Hendricks was the “first imam in the world to come out as gay” in 1996, according to a statement from the advocacy group the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA World) on Saturday.

Rebel coalition,Alliance Fleuve Congo(AFC), which includes the M23 armed group, said in a statement Saturday it had taken control of the Kavumu airport in South Kivu and forced government forces to retreat “in disarray, abandoning the city of Bukavu.”
Bukavu is the provincial capital, where residents also reported looting and fighters in the streets Saturday.
“We have control of Bukavu since this morning,” a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance, Victor Tesongo, told CNN Sunday.
The DRC government has not confirmed the claimed takeover. CNN has approached authorities for comment on the rebels’ claims.
Bukavu resident Elie Cirhuza told CNN he saw M23 fighters on the streets Sunday. “I saw with my eyes the soldiers of the M23. They say they will soon begin to restore order in the city,” said Cirhuza, who lives close to the city center.
He said that government troops were nowhere in sight. “I have not yet seen any government soldiers because downstairs from my house is where they gathered the night before yesterday to flee,” Cirhuza added.

A DRC military spokesperson, Sylvain Ekenge Ekenge, told Reuters on Friday that government forces had retreated from Bukavu after the rebels occupied the airport.
Another resident, Isaac Musharhamina Goldman, said the rebels have occupied strategic points in the city, including the provincial governor’s office and residence.
“They are in the three communes of the city, including the office and residence of the governor of the province, the Saïo military camp, and the site of the National Communication and Satellite Network,” he said. “They also control the two border entrances.”
According to local reports, provincial governor Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki left Bukavu before the rebels advanced into the city. CNN has reached out tohim for comment.
The rapid advance into Bukavu comes less than three weeks after the rebels claimed thetakeover of Goma, the largest city and capital of the neighboring North Kivu province on January 27.
Fighting in Goma between the rebels and DRC’s militaryleft more than 3,000 people dead, according to the government.
Rebel spokesman Tesongo told CNN that the claimed capture of Goma and Bukavu marked the group’s largest territorial acquisition. The cities, with a joint population of more than three million people, are among the most populated in the DRC.
The DRC and many Western countries accuse its neighbor Rwanda of backing M23, which is comprised mainly of ethnic Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than a decade ago.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame, however,told CNNthis month he was unaware whether his nation’s troops were in DRC.
Since 2022, M23 – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsis – has waged a renewed rebellion against the DRC government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.

https://edition.cnn.com/style/ernest-cole-lost-and-found-documentary-raoul-peck-spc/index.html,"Ernest Cole was dying. Lying in a hospital bed in Manhattan, New York, thousands of miles from his homeland of South Africa, the photographer and documenter of apartheid was faced with a bitter irony: he was leaving the world just as his nation was being reborn. The date was February 11, 1990, and on TV, Cole watched Nelson Mandela emerge from prison, taking the final steps of his long walk to freedom. A week later Cole succumbed to pancreatic cancer. He was 49.
A brief obituary inthe New York Timesmentions Cole’s seminal work, “House of Bondage,” a shocking exposé of apartheid in the 1950s and ’60s. Published in 1967 and immediately banned in South Africa, “For many Westerners, it was their first sight of what life was like for blacks in the South African mines, compounds and townships,” the obituarynotes.
“He left South Africa and resettled in the United States in 1966,” itends, before listing his survivors. The statement offers no hint of the circumstances behind his expatriation and the years that followed. He “resettled” — a word that reads like a conclusion to Cole’s story.
Cole never published another book of photography, but nor did he put down his camera when he arrived in New York City. For decades, these photographs were thought lost. Now this body of work is finally emerging; tens of thousands of photographs and reams of writing, forming a second chapter for Cole, the artist in exile.
This story has been given life by filmmaker Raoul Peck and actor LaKeith Stanfield, both Oscar nominees, in the documentary “Ernest Cole: Lost and Found.” The film,which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and debuted in US cinemas in November, comes after“Ernest Cole: The True America,” a book collecting more than 260 photographs from the same new trove, published by Aperture in January with a preface from Peck.
The Haitian filmmaker, whose work spans fiction and non-fiction, has crafted cinematic reappraisals of Black historical figures, including American writer James Baldwin (“I Am Not Your Negro” [2016]) and Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister ofpresent-dayDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). His filmography prompted Cole’s estate to contact the director after it took possession of thousands of previously unseen photographic negatives in 2017.
Peck initially turned down a film, he told CNN in a video interview, but two years later, had a change of heart.
He quickly realized Cole’s voice needed to be front and center. “Too many people have written about him without asking what his own opinion (was) and what his goals and ambitions were,” he said. “I thought, ‘let the man talk.’”
The director penned a screenplay based on Cole’s diaries and letters written in exile, as well as the new photos, and hired Stanfield to voice Cole.
Not looking for an impression but authenticity, he cast the American actor over a South African. “His voice is not pure, it’s not academic,” he said. “I knew that’s what I needed.” The two bonded over their mutual love of photography, and there were tears in the recording booth when Stanfield reached the last, saddest passages of the photographer’s life.
Born near Pretoria in 1940, Cole received his first camera as a teenager. He grew up to become a freelance photographer for DRUM, a South African magazine covering Black culture, and later chief photographer at weekly newspaperBantu World, riling officials with his frank images. He was arrested in 1966 and given the choice to turn informer or go to prison. Instead, he fled to the US with his negatives.
“House of Bondage” published the following year. “That was the first time you basically have a camera inside the belly of the beast,” said Peck.
Cole struggled personally and professionally in the United States. He was stripped of citizenship by South Africa, making travel difficult, and limited by his US patron the Ford Foundation to documenting Black life, mostly in New York and the Jim Crow South. “They put (him) in a box,” said Peck.
The filmmaker shows us a selection of these images. Some are joyous and carefree — particularly those in Harlem; others convey hardships incubated by institutional racism spanning urban and rural Black America. There are direct parallels with his South African oeuvre, yet Cole’s peers judged this work lesser than his apartheid photography.
“Who (were they) to say he lacked passion? (That) it doesn’t show the same risk-taking?” Peck bristled.
“Liberal white gatekeepers, sometimes they are the worst, because they have this additional paternalism,” he added. “They are sure they do (things) for your own good. It’s not even ideology, it’s about, ‘We know it’s difficult, but we know best for you.’”
Has the filmmaker experienced this too? “All the time, even today,” he said. “Except that today I don’t care, and I know how to respond.”
There are plenty of parallels between Peck and his subject. Born in 1953, he and his family left Haiti (“my father” – prominent agronomist Hébert B. Peck – “was arrested twice”) and lived between the DRC, the US and France, before Peck moved to Berlin to study aged 17. (The director would later return to Haiti a notable filmmaker, and served as minister of culture between 1996-97.)
“(In Berlin) most of my friends, who were my elders, were exiled people, the former head of a student movement in Brazil or Nicaragua, a representative of the ANC (African National Congress) in Berlin, a representative of the SWAPO (the Namibian independence movement),” said Peck.
In the film, Cole despairs, “exile is destroying us one by one.”
“You leave your country heartbroken,” the director said. “Then once you are elsewhere, there is not a single day that you don’t think about where you came from — not one single day — to the point you become crazy, paranoiac, withdrawn. I’ve seen all those examples, whether in my own family or with neighbors or people from the Haitian community.”
“It didn’t take long for me to understand every word (Cole) was saying,” he added.
Work dried up for Cole by the early 1970s. The Ford Foundation project went uncompleted. He experienced poverty and homeless on the same New York City streets he had photographed, and according to Peck’s film, didn’t pick up a camera for years.
Peck attributes some of this decline to Cole never being able to escape his apartheid photography — or being allowed to.
Cole laments he did not want to be “a chronicler of misery.” “It was never going to work,” he says of photographing the segregated South, “a territory ironically similar to mine (South Africa).”
Yet Cole was not permitted by patrons to expand into other areas of photography like his White peers, Peck argues: “I think that’s what destroyed him.”
After his death, Cole’s time in America became a footnote with scant evidence attached.
Then in 2017, Cole’s nephew, Leslie Matlaisane, chairperson of the Ernest Cole Family Trust, was contacted by Swedish bank SEB out of the blue, asking if he would collect three safety deposit boxes. Inside were around 60,000 Cole negatives, spanning South Africa and the US, plus his notes and contact sheets. Mysteriously, there were no records associated with the boxes and few opportunities for Matlaisane to ask questions.
How Cole’s archive ended up in the bank vault, why they were released and why now has been the subject of fierce speculation.
Peck features footage of the handover in his film, and says he has a theory of what happened, but he “didn’t want to burden” the documentary by focusing on this outstanding mystery.
The film is heavy enough as is. Hearing Stanfield narrate what Cole called his “slow disintegration and descent into hell” in the US is desperately sad. So too is his conclusion that “New York is a soulless city.” The thrum of the city’s streets and the vitality of its people, as captured by his lens, tells a different story.
The reappraisal of his American photography — “sorely needed,” “cementing the legacy he deserves” — comes too late for Cole.
“He left South Africa and resettled in the United States,” according to the New York Times. The truth Peck brings to us is that Cole was anything but.

Vivian van de Perre, deputy head of the UN mission in DR Congo, said Wednesday that “so far 2,000 bodies have been collected from the Goma streets in recent days, and 900 bodies remain in the morgues of the Goma hospitals.”
“We expect this number to go up,” she told reporters in a video call from the city, which is home to about 2 million people. “There are still many decomposing bodies in certain areas.”
Related articleMore than 150 female inmates raped and burned to death during Goma jailbreak in DRC, UN says
The retrieval of the bodies comes after the rebel coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) – which includes the M23 armed group –announced a ceasefirefrom Tuesday “in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Kinshasa regime,” referring to DR Congo’s government.
The government on Tuesday described the ceasefire as “false communication,” and heavy fighting has continued to be reported in South Kivu province, the UN said Wednesday.
DR Congo – a country of more than 100 million people – has experienced decades of violence driven by ethnic tensions and fights over access to land and mineral resources, causing one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.
Congo, the United States and UN experts accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago.
Rwanda’s government denies the claim, but has acknowledged it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, according to the Associated Press. Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame,told CNN on Mondaythat he didn’t know whether Rwandan military forces were in Congo but said his country would do what’s needed to protect itself.
Since 2022, M23 – which claims to defend the interests of minority communities including the Tutsi – has waged a renewed rebellion against the Congolese government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.
The region is home to rare minerals – including vast deposits of coltan – which is crucial to the production of phones and computers.
Van de Perre said Wednesday that while the UN hoped the ceasefire would hold, “it appears that is not the case,” with ongoing fighting reported along a main road toward the South Kivu capital of Bukavu.
“In Bukavu, tensions are rising as the M23 moves closer, just 50km north of the city,” Van de Perre told reporters, calling the situation in South Kivu province “particularly concerning.”
Rebel groups appear to continue gaining ground in the mineral-rich eastern region, capturing a town 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Bukavu, the Associated Press reported Wednesday, citing civil society officials and residents.

Van de Perre said the UN is “gravely concerned” at losing Bukavu’s Kavumu airport, which she said is “critical for ongoing civilian and humanitarian use around South Kivu.”
The rebel alliance has emphasized previously it has “no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas,” where many displaced people from Goma have fled. “However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,” it said.
Rebels have made a string of territorial acquisitions in recent weeks in the nation’s east and the group’s leader has expressed the intention of capturing more cities, including the national capital Kinshasa.
Kinshasa lies around 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) away from Goma, on the vast country’s western edge.
AFC spokesman Victor Tesongo told CNN Friday rebels were working to “install a new administration” in Goma and advance further into South Kivu and Kinshasa. M23 leader Corneille Nangaa alsotoldRwandan media last week that his group’s objective was “to go to Kinshasa.”
“We are going to fight until we get to Kinshasa. We have come to Goma to stay; we are not going to withdraw. We are going to move forward from Goma to Bukavu … up to Kinshasa,” he said.
In Goma, Van de Perre said the rebel group is consolidating control over the city and territories of North Kivu that it has already seized.
The Congolese government has not confirmed the rebels’ takeover but acknowledged their presence in Goma. Last week, a new military governor was appointed for North Kivu, which was described by the Congolese military as being “under a state of siege.”
“We remain under occupation (in Goma). The situation is still highly volatile with a persistent risk of escalation,” Van de Perre said Wednesday. “All exit routes from Goma are under their control and the airport, also under M23 control, is closed until further notice.”
“The escalating violence has led to immense human suffering, displacement and a growing humanitarian crisis,” Van de Perre said.
Nearly 2,000 civilians are sheltering at UN peacekeeping bases in Goma, she said.

https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/remitances-sub-saharan-africa-technology-spc/index.html,"Millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa rely on money sent to them by relatives living abroad.
But it costs more to send this money — known as remittances — to sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world,according to the World Bank.
In recent years, a number of African-founded financial technology (fintech) companies have emerged, with the aim of bringing down costs and carving into the dominant market share of traditional players like Western Union and MoneyGram.
The potential benefits are huge; the less it costs to send money to Africa, the more money is likely to be sent. An increased flow of foreign currency can act as a lifeline for both individuals and national economies.
Worth $54 billion to sub-Saharan Africa in 2023,remittances account for more than a fifth of GDP of the Gambia, Lesotho, and Comoros, and more than a tenth of Liberia, Cape Verde, and Guinea-Bissau. They are more valuable to Kenyathan its key exports.
And estimates are generally assumed to be lower than the real figure due to the prevalence of unrecorded payments made through informal networks.
“Not only do (remittances to low-and-middle income countries) exceed foreign direct investment and official development assistance (combined), but it also somehow remains constant,” said Christian Kingombe, managing partner of “impact investment” advisor 4IP group, and formerly with the African Development Bank. “So it is really a very important source of development,”he added.
Sending money to sub-Saharan Africa costs the sender an average of 8.37% of the total value of the transaction, as of Q2 2024,according to the World Bank, compared to 5.53% in South Asia. How can fintechs bring that number down?
The first challenge is to move customers away from making cash payments.
A survey by Visa found that 12% of global consumers still send remittances by mail as cash, checks or money orders.
Processing cash is more expensive than digital money, explained Andy Jury, CEO of Mukuru, a big remittance player serving Africa and founded by a Zimbabwean entrepreneur, that processes both cash and digital payments, because cashrequires a large physical infrastructure, including booths, tellers, and supplies of cash.
While the average cost of sending money to sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world, the cost ofdigitalremittances to the region isless than the global average. If more Africans sent money home via digital services rather than cash, average remittance fees should fall, but receiving money online requires the internet, which is used in sub-Saharan Africa by only 37% of people,according to the World Bank.
Even when users have access to mobile apps, it’s not always easy topersuade them to move over from the tried and trusted cash model.
“Imagine a world in which you’ve grown up in a cash-to-cash ecosystem — it’s a sort of leap of faith to leave your money in this esoteric, intangible thing,” explained Jury. “(But) if you get somebody to use it, they educate themselves on the benefit, and they can get that ‘aha!’ moment. That’s the most powerful conversion tool.”
It’s mainly young people who are making the switch, said Nicolai Eddy, COO of NALA, a remittance fintech founded in Tanzania that facilitates payments to 11 African countries and last year raised $40 million from investors. “It’s really like 35 (year olds) and below where there’s a huge focus on the digital side of things,” he said. “People in their fifties and sixties, they’re used to the person at the shop who they know, and they just continue to go there.”
Building trust is a challenge, but with a growing youth population and a steady flow of migrants moving abroad, the potential user base is expanding.
Luring customers over from cash is one piece of the puzzle. But digital payments have their own costs.
Historically, sending money to Africa via a remittance company has been a complex process involving many different parties. “It’s so bloody difficult to move money around,” said Jury.
The middlemen — mainly the third parties used to move money between banks, and the foreign exchangetraders who find and negotiate the best rates — all want a cut, and they can drive up costs and cause delays.
In recent years, fintechs — like NALA, Flutterwave, LemFi, Chipper Cash, Leatherback, and many more — have emerged with a model of cutting out the middlemen and enabling instant payments.
Many of these new fintechs hold liquidity in every country in which they operate, explained Eddy. This allows them to deposit funds directly into the local bank account or digital wallet of the receiver instantly. Often, these companies use their own software wherever possible to move money around, as well as having their own teams to negotiate on the foreign exchange market, removing the reliance on third parties.
“We’re cutting out two steps, in some cases it’s like five or six steps,” explained Eddy.
But bypassing the middlemen is not easy. As well as developing in-house software, it means working directly with banks and governments to acquire licenses to transfer money internally within African countries, each of which has different requirements.
Sending money between African countries can be especially costly; in Q4 of 2023, fees werean average of 33%for remittances of $200 from Tanzania to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda.
“We’ve got 50 different payment use case licenses in 15 different territories, and that’s taken nearly two decades to build up,” said Jury. “Very few environments have alignment in terms of what they require; one market might require a passport as proof of identity, another one might take a driver’s license. All of that variability increases the costs.”
Although still in its infancy, thePan African Payment Settlement System (PAPSS) is designed to unify regulation across different African countries.
“I love that sort of stuff because it creates harmony,” said Jury. “Whether it’s centrally dictated, whether it’s ourselves creatively integrating (with other fintechs), we’re constantly on the lookout for those things.”
The UN has targeted aglobal average of 3% for remittance fees. According to Eddy, the biggest inhibitor for fintechs in Africa to lower their costs is the fees charged by banks and digital wallets for locally depositing money to receivers. He wants governments to limit fees for things like sending money to family. “If they cap those fees for those types of transactions, we could be processing at 1% (total fees),” he said.
But according to Dr Joseph Antwi Baafi, senior lecturer at Akentien Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development in Kumasi, Ghana, governments should focus on helping to reduce operating costs for remittance fintechs and the companies that operate digital wallets in Africa.
“Governments (can play) a huge role in terms of infrastructure support, in terms of tax support, to help these network operators to operate at their full capacity and full efficiency. And that will bring down charges,” he said.
For Jury, the key to success is to tailor the product to the user’s needs.
“If you come at this with a Silicon Valley mind(set) where you’re going to take a small proposition, throw lots of money (at it) and scale it up, you come unstuck very quickly,” Jury said.
“But if you can take a global platform or infrastructure and ensure you appreciate the local idiosyncrasies and invent something that’s relevant to a customer, there’s a massive, massive tidal wave of opportunity coming.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/21/africa/us-aid-freeze-hiv-orphans-kenya-intl/index.html,"Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children’s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.
Nyumbani Children’s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.
US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to freeze USAID’s funding means Nyumbani’s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.
Trump’s order seeks to review almost all US foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.
For children at Nyumbani Children’s Home, it’s a life and death situation. As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers’ faces.
The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It’s a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy — who has been looking after children here for 28 years — is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.
“When we started caring for them, they didn’t look like they had life in them,” she said. “One after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don’t want to see that happen again.”
When Nyumbani, which means “Home” in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.

The 2003 inception of the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR’s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.
“USAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,” said Palakudy. “We put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.”
Over the last two decades, the US government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.
USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.
Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.
According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.
Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.
The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.
With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.
“The future is uncertain,” said Wamboye. “The Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.”
According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump’s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.

One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. “I had a very weak immune system,” she said. “This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.”
Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.
“I am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,” she said.
On average, the children’s home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.
Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.
“This is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it’s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,” she said.",africa

These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.
The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.
The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.

There have long been concerns aboutdiseases jumping from animals to humansin places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.
After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.

https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/hyacinth-alien-plant-environment-plastic-spc/index.html,"Lake Naivasha, northwest of Nairobi, Kenya is becoming increasingly unnavigable. Water hyacinth,the world’s most widespread invasive species, is blanketing the lake, choking its fish and leaving people stranded.
“Sometimes it becomes very serious,” says Simon Macharia, a local fisherman, about theweed problem. “There was this incident where fishermen were trapped by hyacinth inside the lake for three days. We had to seek help from the government (who) used a helicopter to rescue them.”
Macharia says that some days he’s simply unable to fish on the lake because of the plant. When he does, he can lose his nets underneath the floating weed, incurring costs while preventing him from earning that day. Water hyacinths also cover the surface, cutting off sunlight, outcompeting other plant species and starving water of oxygen. That means there are fewer fish for Macharia to catch in the first place.
The problem is so vastit can be seen from space. It also threatens the cut off the flower industry in the wetlands surrounding the 150 square kilometer (58 square mile) lake.
What’s happening in Lake Naivasha is a story repeated all over the world. Water hyacinths are native to South America, but were introduced as an exotic ornamental to many other countries. They’ve since taken over freshwater environments and are labeled an alien invasive species on every other continent aside from Antarctica.
As well as their impact on biodiversity and livelihoods, the floating plant can clog hydroelectric and irrigation systems, meaning that one does not need to live in their proximity to be affected. It’s the highest-profile example of an invasive aquatic plant crisis that has cost the global economy tens of billions of dollars historically, and nowmore than $700 million annually.
The problem with water hyacinths is particularly acute in Africa. A 2024 report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a body founded by the UN Environment Programme, described the plant’s “exponential expansion,” with land use changes and climate change adding potential fuel to the fire.
Taskforces from multiple organizations have attempted to find solutions. Introducing weevils that attack the plant can restrict its spread and even cause it to lose buoyancy. There are also proposals to harvest the water hyacinth and combine it with municipal waste and cow dungto produce biofuel. Now a Kenyan company is addressing the problem as well as the country’s plastic pollution issueby turning the invasive plant into a bioplastic.
HyaPak Ecotech Limited, founded by Joseph Nguthiru, began life as a final year project by the former Egerton University civil and environmentalengineering student. Nguthiru and his classmates experienced the problem of water hyacinths firsthand on a field trip to Lake Naivasha in 2021, when their boat became trapped for five hours. They returned determined to do something about it.
Nguthiru’s bioplastic is made from dried water hyacinth combined with binders and additives, which is then mixed and shaped.
The product, which biodegrades over a few months, was first used as an alternative for plastic packaging. In 2017, Kenya introduced a law banning single-use plastic bags, and in 2020 all single-use plastics were banned from protected areas. The results have been mixed; with homegrown manufacturing banned, there have beenreports that single-use plastic bags have been smuggled into Kenya from neighboring countries. “The problem behind (the ban) is that there were no proper alternatives that were produced,” argued Nguthiru.
His product is “killing two birds with one stone,” he believes. “Most single-use plastic products tend to have a lifespan of about 10 minutes after they come out of supermarket shelves. So why not make them biodegradable?”
HyaPak has gained widespread attention, winning the Youth category at the East Africa Climate Action Awards,a prize at UNESCO’s World Engineering Day Hackathon, and a Prototype for Humanity Award 2023 announced at  the COP28 climate conference. Nguthiru was also named a 2023 Obama Foundation Africa Leader.
Fishermen including Macharia are now harvesting the invasive plant on Lake Naivasha, then drying and selling it to HyaPak. It’s a useful alternative income, he said, especially on days when the plant has covered his net, preventing it from catching fish.
Macharia said he hopes HyaPak will soon be able to scale up its activities, allowing the lake’s surrounding community to harvest greater quantities of water hyacinth. “If Joseph could get funding, I think he can buy larger quantities and at least many people will get work,” he said.
One project that could help HyaPak grow is its partnership with the Kenyan government to use its products as part of a flagship reforestation scheme.
According to Global Forest Watch, Kenya lost 14% of its tree cover between 2001 and 2023.In late 2022, Kenya’s Forestry and Land Restoration Acceleration program committed to planting 15 billion seedlings by 2032 on degraded forest and rangeland. Doing so would bring the nation’s tree coverage to over 30 percent,said the government.
All those seedlings need bags in which to grow and be transported, and HyaPak’s seedling bags are part of the plan, said Nguthiru.
A plastic-based seedling bag has a carbon footprint of 1.6-1.7 kilograms, according to Nguthiru, and it is disposed of when the seedling is planted. HyaPak’s alternative is planted with the seedling and biodegrades, releasing nutrients including nitrogen. What’s more, during the seedling’s first months, the bioplastic slows water seeping into the surrounding soil, reducing the amount of watering required.
“You offset the carbon emissions that are going to be produced, you’ve used less water, you’ve added more nutrients … it’s a win-win situation for communities, for the planet and for yourself as a farmer,” Nguthiru argued.
HyaPak is already exporting to the US and Germany and plans to establish franchises in India and El Salvador – two countries with freshwater blighted by water hyacinth.
Nguthiru wants to create the quickest route for the world to benefit from his innovation, “Even if that means open-sourcing some of this, so that the product and development and advancement of biodegradable plastic can go really fast, so be it.”
Beyond water hyacinth, he thinks urgent action is needed to tackle the climate crisis: “Previous generations have failed us, and the ones that are coming afterwards are looking up to us. We are the ones who are going to live with a planet that’s beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (global temperature rise),” he said.
“It’s up to my generation to come up with solutions for the climate crisis, because if we don’t do it, we are not going to do it at all.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/08/africa/eastern-southern-african-leaders-unprecedented-summit-congo-intl/index.html,"Leaders of Eastern and Southern African regional blocs met for an unprecedented joint summit on Saturday to find a solution to a conflict in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed rebels’ rapid advance since January has fanned fears of a wider war.
The M23 rebels last weekcaptured Goma,the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo - the worst escalation of fighting in more than a decade that has left thousands dead. Despite announcing a unilateral ceasefire, they have continued to march southtowards the city of Bukavu.
Presidents, including Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, lined up on stage at the start of talks in Dar es Salaam. Congo’s Felix Tshisekedi attended via video link.
“History will judge us harshly if we remain still and watch the situation worsen, day by day,” Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan said at the opening ceremony.
The first-ever summit of both Eastern and Southern African blocs points to the continent’s deep concern over the crisis and the standoff between Congo and neighboring Rwanda, which denies allegations it is fueling the conflict with its own troops and weapons.
The two groupings have, so far, been broadly divided over the conflict, with the eastern bloc closer to Rwanda’s call for dialogue and southern countries backing Congo and angry over the deaths of peacekeepers, experts and diplomats said.
The leaders are seeking a breakthrough after two peace processes in Luanda and Nairobi stalled as tensions escalated.
The blocs’ foreign ministers have recommended the summit consider calling for the cessation of hostilities, an unconditional ceasefire, and the reopening of Goma airport and other key routes for the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian aid.
Over the past month, M23’s lightning advances have expanded its control over North Kivu province’s lucrative coltan, gold and tin ore mines, uprooting thousands in what was already one of the world’s most dire humanitarian crises.

Aid groups have been helping to relieve overwhelmed hospitals as health workersrace against timeto bury the bodies of at least 2,000 people killed in the battle for Goma, amid concerns of disease spreading.
Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court say they areclosely monitoringthe bloodshed, where reports are emerging of rape,gang rapeand sexual slavery, according to the U.N. human rights office.
Ahead of the summit, the United States warned ofpossible sanctions againstRwandan and Congolese officials, further raising the stakes for finding a solution to a conflict that is rooted in the long fallout from the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the struggle for control of Congo’s mineral resources.
Well-trained and professionally armed, M23 is the latest in a long line of ethnic Tutsi-led rebel movements to emerge in Congo’s volatile east. Congo’s government says it is a Rwandan proxy, which the rebel group denies.

Armed forces in Sudan’s ongoing civil war are perpetrating systematic sexual violence against young children, with one-year-olds the youngest survivors of rape, according to a new report from UNICEF, the United Nations’ (UN) children’s agency.
The UNICEF report, released Tuesday, said that at least 221 cases of child rape had been recorded since the beginning of 2024, along with an additional 77 reported cases of sexual assault against children.

Four one-year-olds were among those who survived sexual assaults, while another 12 survivors were children under the age of 5, according to the report. Of the rape survivors, 66% are girls and 33% are boys.
The data, compiled by gender-based violence service providers in Sudan, only represent a “small fraction” of the total child rape cases, UNICEF said, noting that survivors, their families and even frontline workers are often unwilling or unable to report the crimes due to challenges around accessing services, cultural stigmas and the fear of retribution from armed groups.
The report, which detailed firsthand accounts of sexual violence against children from December 2024 and January 2025, found that children were sexually abused during invasions of cities, while fleeing danger, while being held against their will or in detention – and sometimes in exchange for food or other essential supplies.
Sudan has beengripped by warfor nearly two years, as forces loyal to two rival generals fight for control of the country.
The generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more.
Since April 2023, more than 28,700 people have been killed according to theArmed Conflict Location and Event Data initiative, and more than 11 million have been forced to flee their homes.
UNICEF received firsthand reports of “armed men storming homes and demanding at gunpoint that families surrender their girls, often while violently attacking the family members or raping the girls in front of their loved ones,” according to the report.
Frontline workers have seen an increase of violence against internally displaced people living in shelters or who are sheltering at informal sites, UNICEF said, noting that the risk of sexual violence is high within these communities, especially against children.
CNN has contacted both the SAF and RSF for comment.
One rape survivor, a woman who asked to be called Omnia, told UNICEF that she was detained by armed men for 19 days. She said that she became suicidal after hearing young girls being raped every night.
“After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her… She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious,” Omnia said.
Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director said the testimonies should “shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,” adding that “widespread sexual violence in Sudan has instilled terror in people, especially children.”
The report noted that violence is not limited to only one part of Sudan and that cases of child rape were reported in nine states across the country.
The SAF controls the eastern and northern parts of the country,according to the British government, while the RSF controls western, southern and central Sudan – including the Darfur region.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/12/africa/fighting-drc-congo-minerals-phone-intl/index.html,"A rampaging rebel group has claimed the capture of another mining town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a little over a week after it took control of the region’s largest city Goma.
Clashes between the rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) and Congolese forces have left more than 3,000 people dead in less than two weeks, according to DRC’s government.
The  AFC, of which the M23 armed group – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities – is a key member, took over resource-rich Nyabibwe last week after Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, fell on January 27.
It comes less than a year after the rebels seized Rubaya, a mining hub also in the country’s east, which harbors one of the world’s largest deposits of coltan, a valuable mineral used in the production of smartphones.
Here’s what you need to know.
For decades, DRC, a Central African nation of more than 100 million people, has grappled with bloody militia violence, includingethnic and resource-driven armed rebellionby M23 and dozens of other armed groups.
Roughly the size of Western Europe, the war-riven country is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including the world’s largest reserves of cobalt and coltan – both critical to the production of electronics. Cobalt is used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles, while coltan is refined into tantalum, which has a variety of applications in phones and other devices.
However,according to the World Bank“most people in DRC have not benefited from this wealth,” and the country ranks among the five poorest nations in the world.
Much of DRC’s mineral wealth is split between its government and armed groups who control swathes of the resource-rich east.
“Access to natural resources is at the heart of this conflict,” Jean Pierre Okenda, an analyst specializing in extractive industries governance, told CNN about the M23-led takeover of territories in the east.
“It’s not a coincidence that the zones occupied by the rebels are mining areas,” Okenda said, adding that global demand for cobalt and coltan has fueled the crisis.
“It takes money to wage war. Access to mining sites finances the war,” he added.
Victor Tesongo, a spokesperson for the AFC-M23 rebel alliance, told CNN that the group was in control of the coltan-rich Rubaya and Nyabibwe mines, but stopped short of saying how much money it has derived from them or what it has been spent on.
But a top United Nations official has an idea.
Bintou Keita, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative to the DRC,told the Security Councilin a September briefing that coltan trade from Rubaya’s mines is estimated to supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production and generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue a month for M23.
M23deniedthese claims, insisting its presence in Rubaya was “solely humanitarian.”

Much of the international community, including the Congolese government, has accused  neighboring Rwanda of backing M23 and aiding the plunder of DRC minerals.
UN experts believe that anestimated 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiersare supervising and supporting M23 fighters in eastern DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country. A Decemberreportby the UN Group of Experts on the DRC revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.”
DRC Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya told CNN last week that “Rwanda’s mineral exports surged after its forces took control of key mining zones in DRC.”
Rwanda is one of the world’s top suppliers of coltan and hassurpassed DRC’s export of the mineralin recent years.
Rwandan President Paul Kagametold CNNlast week that his country gets coltan from its mines and said that he didn’t know whether Rwandan troops were in DRC.
In apublic addressthat drew outrage last year, Kagame admitted that Rwanda was a transit point for minerals smuggled from DRC, but insisted his country was not stealing from its neighbor.
“Some people come from Congo; whether they smuggle or go through the right channels, they bring minerals. Most of it goes through here (Rwanda) but does not stay here. It goes to Dubai, Brussels, Tel Aviv, (and) Russia. It goes everywhere,” Kagame said, without providing evidence or specifying what minerals were being smuggled.
CNN has reached out to his government’s spokesperson for comment.
In 2022, the United States Treasury Departmentsaidthat over 90% of DRC’s gold was being “smuggled to regional states, including Uganda and Rwanda” where they are “refined and exported to international markets, particularly the UAE,” and sanctioned a Belgian businessman for facilitating the trade.
For DRC’s other valuable minerals including coltan and cobalt, the scale of the plunder remains unclear.
In December, DRCsuedsubsidiaries of  Apple in Belgium and France, accusing the company of sourcing conflict minerals. Apple denied the accusation.
Every year, tech giants such asAppleandMicrosoftpublish reports saying that they demand responsible sourcing of minerals from their suppliers.
In an earlierfiling to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023, Apple said that while it continued to source 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) and other minerals such as cobalt and lithium from DRC and other countries, it was “committed to meeting and exceeding internationally accepted due diligence standards for primary minerals and recycled materials in our supply chain.” It added that its due diligence efforts had “found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country.”
DRC’s mineral wealth has presented itself as a “curse,” according to analyst Okenda, who explained:
“These resources create wars, create rebellions, expose local populations, and also create serious ecological problems,” he told CNN.
Last week, ahumanitarian ceasefireannounced by M23 fell apart almost immediately after it was declared, as the rebels swiftly advanced into Nyabibwe.

While regional and global leaders ponder solutions to ending the crisis, Okenda  believes that DRC’s government needs to reinvent itself if it hopes for lasting peace.
DRC “has a governance model that if it does not change, the Congolese population will gain absolutely nothing, whether there is war or not,” he said.
“If the Kinshasa government improves its governance, invests in the army, ensures a fair sharing of resources between citizens in the country, and conducts elections that are of better quality, I still think that peace can return (to DRC),” he said.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/26/africa/sudan-plane-crash-death-toll-intl-latam/index.html,"The death toll from a Sudanese military aircraft crash in thecity of Omdurmanincreased to at least 46 people, including women and children, officials said Wednesday, one of the deadliest plane crashes in the northeastern African nation in the past two decades.
The Antonov aircraft crashed on Tuesday over a populated district in Omdurman, also injuring at least 10 people, according to the government-run Khartoum Media Office. An initial death toll of 19 was provided by the health ministry.
The military said in a statement that the plane crashed while taking off from the Wadi Sayidna air base north of Omdurman, the sister city of the capital, Khartoum.
The crash also damaged a number of houses in the Karrari district of Omdurman, the media office said.
The military earlier said that armed forces personnel and civilians were killed in the crash, but didn’t provide figures. It didn’t say what caused the crash.
The health ministry said some bodies were transferred to the Nau hospital in Omdurman.
Among the dead were senior military officers, including Maj. Gen. Bahr Ahmed Bahr and Lt. Col. Awad Ayoub, and the aircraft crew, according to a military official.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said the dead include women and children, among them five siblings.
Local media reported that the aircraft was on the way to the Red Sea city ofPort Sudan, the seat of the military-backed government, when it crashed over the Al-Thawra neighborhood in the Karrari district. Residents reported loud explosions from the crash, which sent thick clouds of smoke and dust over Omdurman.
Aircraft crashes are common in Sudan, which has a poor aviation safety record. In 2020, at least 16 people were killed when amilitary plane,a Russian Antonov An-12, crashed in the western region of Darfur.
In 2003, a civilian Sudan Airways plane crashed into a hillside while trying to make an emergency landing, killing 116 people, including eight foreigners. Only a boy survived the crash.
Sudan is also battling a cholera outbreak that has killed 1,472 people across a dozen provinces in recent months, the Health Ministry said. The disease has sickened around 56,000 since it was detected in July last year.
The dead included over 70 people who died in two cities in the White Nile province earlier this month, the ministry said. More than 2,000 others were diagnosed with the disease in the cities of Kosti and Rabak, it said.

The outbreak was detected last year during the rainy season between July and October. Heavy rainfall and floods especially hit the country’s eastern areas where millions of war displaced people sheltered.
The outbreak added further burdens on the country, which has suffered from nearly two years of devastating war.
Sudan has been in a state of civil war since 2023 when tensions between the military and a notorious paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare.
The fighting has wrecked urban areas and has been marked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings, that amount towar crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.

It’s a world of endless parties and sleepless nights. A relentless celebration that turns West Africa – and especially Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos – into one of the hottest destinations on the continent, if not the planet, right in the middle of winter.
Detty December is a magical time between December and early January when diaspora communities and tourists flock to Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa for an unforgettable experience filled with flavourful food, soulful African music and sunshine.
Beach parties, festivals and top-tier performances fuel the energy, while fashion takes center stage, with everyone dressing to impress.
Nearly two-thirds of Nigeria’s population is under 25, according to the United Nations Population Fund, making this one of the world’s youngest countries.
Internationally renowned Afrobeats performers and foreign artists make surprise appearances. DJs take to the streets, blasting powerful beats from consoles mounted atop bright yellow minibuses.
At times it’s all-consuming. Good luck getting hair salon appointments, affordable air tickets or navigating Lagos’ already notorious traffic when the party crowds are in town.
Detty December (“detty” is a playful corruption of “dirty”) is a triumphant celebration of culture, music and good vibes that has evolved in recent years during the traditional holidays influx of diaspora returnees, which heightened in 2018 when Ghana ran a launched a successful “Year of Return” campaign actively encouraging people to visit their ancestral homelands.
It’s gathered pace over the past five years, gaining an international reputation, as IJGBs (“I Just Got Backs”) and their friends arrive in batches, eager to unwind and blow off steam after the fast-paced, hard-working year they’ve had overseas.
For many in the vast Nigerian diaspora, it is a deeply personal homecoming, a chance to reconnect with their heritage, traditions and families while immersing themselves in the lively energy of Nigerian life.
Cynthia Eniola Oyeneyin, who moved from Nigeria to the UK at the age of nine, is a Detty December regular. Despite living abroad for most of her life, she returns to Nigeria every year to reunite with family and friends.
“It’s always important for me to go back to my roots and to go back to my culture,” she says. “Nigeria, for me, will always be home, so when I go back, I’m happiest. And mainly because, especially in December, everyone is on a vibe of happiness.”
Many locals also look forward to joining the party.
“I also look forward to attending Christmas parties and family Christmas gatherings which is a cultural thing in Nigeria where we cook and host each other and it’s always a good time,” says Ademidun Akindele. “This December was really good. Lagos is extremely populated during this time of the year but I can’t complain because it’s good for the economy and it’s amazing to see people.”

What makes the Nigerian Detty December unique?
For starters, Nigeria’s entertainment scene is buzzing during Detty December, offering an abundance of performances headlined by some of the biggest Afrobeats stars, likeBurna Boy,Wizkid,Ayra StarrandTems.
Festivals such as the Calabar Carnival in Cross River State, referred to as “Africa’s biggest street party,” and the Flytime Fest music festival in Lagos provide once-in-a-lifetime experiences, drawing massive crowds eager to immerse themselves in the culture.
Many events are organized by Cultur FM, an influential brand that boasts a large global presence and serves as a unique platform celebrating the richness of African music. It aims to spotlight the often-overlooked talent in the genre, shifting focus from Western DJs who have embraced these sounds to the African artists and DJs who define them.
During the latest Detty December, Cultur FM staged a series of creative events in Lagos. Collaborating with brands like Air Peace, Pepsi Nigeria and Hennessy Nigeria on gatherings that celebrated African pride while connecting deeply with local communities.
“We wanted to go back to where it all started,” a Cultur FM founder told CNN Travel. He didn’t want his name revealed in line with the organization’s brand anonymity.
“It was essential to involve local people and celebrate the vibrant creativity of these streets.”
He said the standout from the 2024 lineup was an unforgettable block party in Surulere, the iconic Lagos neighborhood that birthed music legends like Wizkid andOxlade.
Departing from the typical glitzy beach club scene, this free community event aimed to honor its roots. DJ booths were set up on yellow mini-buses, Oxlade delivered an electrifying performance, and brands distributed free merchandise and drinks.
As Detty December gains prominence each year, so does Cultur FM’s influence. The group plans to expand into Ghana and South Africa, continuing to disrupt the music scene, inspire pride in African heritage and connect the diaspora with its roots.
But it’s not just the events — FOMO (fear of missing out) is real!
Lagos during Detty December is bustling with energy, and even if you’re not there, social media feeds will be packed with pictures and videos of people’s highlight reels from their vacations.
From glamorous weddings — because, lest we forget, December is peak wedding season in Nigeria — to house parties, beach day parties and long-awaited family reunions, there’s never a dull moment.
For most tourists and the Nigerian diaspora, the trip feels worth every penny. The favorable currency conversion for travelers from countries such as the UK, the US and Canada makes luxury experiences and indulgences more accessible.
This affordability, combined with the promise of unforgettable memories, makes it hard to resist hopping on a plane for the ultimate holiday. And that’s not all: Local businesses thrive during this period, with vendors, restaurants, and hotels reaping the rewards, in turn providing a boost to the Nigerian economy.

“One of the things I’ve observed the most is the positive economic impact this December has on Nigeria,” says Cynthia. “People are coming to Nigeria to have fun and pumping money into the economy, bringing in more jobs for, you know, the less fortunate as well, and it’s so beautiful to watch.”
Of course, no good thing comes without challenges. While Detty December feels like a haven of fun, there are certainly drawbacks. Flights to Lagos from the UK, US, and Canada become expensive, especially during this period, prompting  IJGBs and frequent visitors to book within the first three months of the year to avoid sky-high costs.
Additionally, as an emerging market, Nigeria’s infrastructure often struggles to handle the influx of visitors during Detty December, leading to severe traffic jams that are a nightmare to navigate.
“Lagos is already populated, but come December, you know most people in the diaspora come to Nigeria,” says Ademidun. “This year, I even noticed more people who aren’t even of Nigerian heritage coming into the country to participate in the events, which was interesting, but it just meant everywhere was packed. So, getting a nail appointment, or a hair appointment wasn’t impossible but it was tricky. There is also a lot of traffic, which we expected but traffic jams are a major hindrance of enjoyment.”
Ademidun’s experience highlights the strain on everyday life during Detty December. But beyond the inconvenience, there’s a deeper issue at play – the impact the celebration has on locals.
Many would like to experience the festivities in full but are met with soaring prices driven up by tourists with deep pockets. Thiseffectively excludessome from enjoying simple pleasures like food, events, beach clubs, and getaways in their own country.
Despite these challenges, Detty December has elevated Nigeria’s global profile, drawing visitors eager to immerse themselves in the festivities. The rich culture, nonstop entertainment, and viral #DettyDecember posts have transformed the country into an even more sought-after vacation destination.
Beyond the partying, it serves as a stage for cultural exports, from authentic traditional cuisine to Afrobeats and the resurgence of Y2K fashion, infused with fashions inspired by Nigeria’s “Nollywood” movie scene, turning every moment of Detty December into a celebration of Nigeria’s cultural richness.
Detty December is no ordinary festive season, it’s a movement that unites people from all walks of life in a celebration of African excellence. It places West Africa in the spotlight and as Lagos shines brightly for the world to see, it’s evident that this isn’t merely a homecoming for the diaspora or a festive holiday destination — it’s an ode to Nigeria’s unyielding spirit and its ever-growing influence on the global cultural stage.",africa

The vast piece of infrastructure opened officially last year after a decade of work and$1.2 billionof investment. Now, when one country needs more electricity for its national grid and the other has a surplus, electricity automatically flows across the border, along 650 miles of transmission lines, so that supply meets demand. Last week, a Kenya-Tanzania link began operations, which will let energy flow across that border, too.
Experts saysharing electricity (or “power sharing”) between African countries is fundamental to a successful clean energy transition. According to Darlain Edeme, African Energy Analyst for the International Energy Agency (IEA), it can “improve quality, reliability, security, and have benefits on prices,” in a continent where demand for electricity is rapidly increasing.
In Ethiopia, a country with a population of nearly 130 million, electricity consumption per capitaquadrupledbetween 2000 and 2022. In Kenya, itrose by three quarterswithin the same period. And it’s set to continue rising – in 2017 Ethiopia launched its National Electrification Plan that aimed to achieve universal electrification by 2025, despite only about one in four rural households currently having access to electricity. Across Africa, theUN has targeteduniversal access to electricity by 2030, which would mean adding the 600 million people currently without it – nearly half the population of the continent – in the next five years.
With a rising energy access deficit – the difference between supply and demand – it makes sense for neighbors to pool their resources. But power sharing requires sophisticated infrastructure – namely, interconnectors – transmission lines that enable electricity to flow both ways across a border or over a large distance.
And it’s expensive, too. The Ethiopia-Kenya Electricity Highway follows the model of other interconnectors in Africa, including one betweenZambia and Namibia, which has run since 2010 and cost $300 million to construct, and a 1,000-mile interconnectorbetween two regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, running since 1982 and costing over $800 million.
For the African Development Bank (AfDB), which contributedover $300 million of fundingtowards the Ethiopia-Kenya link, it’s worth it. “You see population growth somewhat outstripping the growth of new connections,” said Daniel Schroth, director of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Department at the AfDB. “There’s a big push on addressing this energy access deficit more decisively.”
Since the highway opened, Ethiopia’s electricity supply has provided vital backup for Kenya, which has been importing 200 megawatts (MW) of power dailyfrom its neighbor, equivalent to around 10% of the peak demand of Kenya’s national grid. The interconnector has the capacity to transfer up to 2,000 MW.
For many countries in East Africa with a history of power outages, including Ethiopia and Kenya, access to a backup supply could be a lifeline. But while Alemayehu Wubeshet Zegeye, manager for Regional Power Systems Operations in the East African Region for the AfDB, said that the new interconnector “absolutely will reduce the number of blackouts,” it cannot remove them entirely. IEA analyst Edeme said that while having access to backup supplies of electricity is one thing, having functioning utilities to distribute it is another. Across Africa, he said, utilities “are not in the best shape from a financial perspective.”
In September,Reuters reportedtwo “major blackouts” in Kenya in a single week, with Energy Minister Opiyo Wandayi blaming “sub-optimal investment in infrastructure.”
The Ethiopia-Kenya Electricity Highway, also funded by the World Bank, is one part of a wider project for theEastern African Power Pool(EAPP), a group of 13 countries brought together to meet rising demand for electricity and ensure backup supplies.
The EAPP is one of five power pools in Africa, which, with the help of interconnectors, could one day link together the energy supplies of every region in the continent.
“The vision clearly articulated by the African Union is to create an African single electricity market building on the regional power pools being interconnected,” said Schroth. The hope is that with increased competition will come falling prices for consumers, and new sources of revenue for countries producing surplus energy that – in the absence of expensive storage systems – would otherwise go to waste. Already, due to the electricity highway, Ethiopia has increased revenue from its electricity exports, which were previously limited to Djibouti, by almost a half, according to Zegeye.
Having added the Kenya-Tanzania interconnector to its power sharing network, the next target for the EAPP is to link Tanzania (and therefore Kenya and Ethiopia, too)to Zambia, both countries in theSouthern African Power Pool(SAPP).
Interconnectors are popular outside Africa, too, with a network ofover 400in Europe. A link between Spain and Morocco already connects the electricity supplies of Europe and Africa, and another – between Greece and Egypt – is currently under construction, with the aim of completionby 2029.
“I think there has been a rallying call over the last two years,” said Schroth, explaining the proliferation of interconnector projects across the continent and the world. “There won’t be an energy transition without transmission.”
With more funding and international cooperation, there is hope that Africa will one day become a clean energy powerhouse. “I’m optimistic,” said Edeme, “I see a lot of momentum right now in the sector.”",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/30/style/alayo-akinkugbe-ablackarthistory-curator/index.html,"Editor’s Note: Curator and art historian Alayo Akinkugbe is CNN Style’s guest editor for the month of November. Clickhereto read the feature Akinkugbe commissioned on fine art and Nigerian craft.
Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s 19th century painting, “The Beloved,” a bejeweled Black child offers a bouquet of roses to the pale, red-headed bride at the picture’s center. The child is tucked away in the bottom left-hand corner, but in the mind of curator and art historian Alayo Akinkugbe, his presence fills the entire frame. His story — how he caught Rossetti’s eye while traveling with his slave master, and how Rossetti later likened his complexion to that of jet stone — is laid out by Akinkugbe on her Instagram account@ablackhistoryofart, where her 65,400 followers eagerly await these rare shards of art history.
The roles of these Black figures on the canvases in which they appear might seem minor. They are often pushed to the peripheral, into the background, while some — such as the enslaved teenager Bélizaire fromJacques Amans’ 1837 group portrait— have been erased altogether. But Akinkugbe holds a magnifying glass over these slim fragments, off-cuts of the dominant whitewashed narrative of art history, and forces them to take up space.
At 24, Akinkugbe has already worked with some of the UK’s most prestigious art institutions, from the Tate to the National Gallery, interviewing artists and further contextualizing Black works in permanent collections on social media. Last year she was spotlighted on the Dazed100 list for art and photography. In February, she joined the Royal Academy of Arts as a researcher for the exhibition “Entangled Pasts,” which explored the far reaching effects of colonialism in art from 1768 to present day. This summer she curated her first solo exhibition,“The Whole World Smiles With You,”at Opera Gallery in London.
But growing up in Lagos, Nigeria, a career as an art historian seemed very far away. “My parents weren’t that keen,” Akinkugbe told CNN in a video interview. “I think a lot of it was down to the fact that (art history) is viewed as an elite, white field. They couldn’t see me, I guess, succeeding if I were to pursue a career in the arts.”

Akinkugbe lived in Nigeria until she was 11, and though she doesn’t remember visiting galleries (“the museums are poorly funded by the government… I didn’t know anyone who would go to any of the museums we have in Lagos,”) she was surrounded by art. Vendors on the street selling bright imitation modernist paintings or larger-than-life murals, such as the vivid blue and green painted pillars by Polly Alakija under Falomo Bridge, are early memories for Akinkugbe. “Art was everywhere,” she said. “But not in the formal Western sense.” In her own home, along with the homes of her grandparents and her friend’s parents, sculptures often lined the walls. “I distinctly remember everywhere people would have either bronze sculptures, similar to Benin bronzes,” she said. “Or a lot of mahogany carvings… Before colonialism, painting wasn’t a thing. Our visual culture has very much been sculptural.”
Her interest in Blackness and visibility — particularly who gets to make it onto the canvas and why — began early on, while Akinkugbe was at school. Her Nigerian private school taught a British curriculum (“it was very clearly trying to get people on the path of studying in the UK,”) which felt like a missed opportunity to connect with her heritage. “It’s a bit sad that happens here,” she said. “That people are so set on not even learning our own history, or about our own culture… I look back and I’m like why would children in Nigeria be studying Tudors before learning about our own history?”
It prepared her, in a way, for the feelings of displacement that came with a move to the UK — where she was the only Black history of art student in her year at the University of Cambridge. “I felt hyper visible,” she said. “I think the feeling followed me.” It wasn’t until Akinkugbe was halfway through her undergraduate degree that a Black artist was introduced onto the curriculum. “It was the first time in my whole study that I learned about a Black artist at Cambridge… That was life changing. I really felt connected to what was being presented to me.”
Worried that her only opportunity to engage critically with Black art was over, Akinkugbe set up her Instagram account as a kind of research diary. It was soon recommended by the New York Times as one of five Instagram accounts to follow immediately. “I didn’t expect so many people to be interested in it,” she said. “I didn’t think that ideas about Black representation could gain such momentum, but the timing was probably the reason why.” A few months after launching @ablackhistoryofart, the death of George Floyd ignited the revival of the Black Lives Matter protest movement. The coincidence at times feels “sinister” for Akinkugbe, but she believes there is longevity in the increased interest in and support for Black art and artists.
“I’ve spoken a lot about how there was a wave,” she said. “And it feels like it’s peaked. And now there might be a trough… I don’t think the level of attention that (Black art) was given straight after the (resurgence) of Black Lives Matter will last,” she told CNN. “You can already see it beginning to dissipate.”
“But I do think that as long as the topic remains relevant, which it will be until things change, then it does have longevity.” It’s clear that whether Akinkugbe is curating art to be mounted on an institution’s wall, or posting a 1080 x 1080 pixel square online, Blackness will remain in frame.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/14/africa/paramilitary-forces-raid-sudan-largest-refugee-camp-intl/index.html,"Fighters from Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have torched swathes of the country’s largest refugee camp, firing indiscriminately at civilians, according to open-source data and an eyewitness account.
At least seven people have been killed and 40 injured in the attacks which began on Tuesday, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which operates one of the last remaining healthcare facilities in Zamzam camp, which hosts nearly half a million displaced people suffering from famine. Approximately 50% of Zamzam’s central market was burned in the attacks, according to a newYale HRL report.
Once a refuge for civilians fleeing violence in North Darfur’s capital city of al-Fasher and neighboring towns, Zamzam has been under fire since December 1, according to Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) which monitors the conflict, and MSF. Indiscriminate artillery fire has killed and injured dozens of residents since, the medical relief group says.
The RSF and its rival, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), have been locked in a brutal civil war since April of 2023. Since then, the RSF has been campaigning to capture al-Fasher —the last remaining SAF stronghold in the region — 15km north of Zamzam. However, this is the first time that RSF fighters appear to have entered the camp.
CNN reviewed eyewitness testimony, open-source data and spoke with humanitarian groups operating locally to illuminate the RSF’s back-to-back assaults on Zamzam.
On Tuesday, RSF fighters approached the camp from the east before entering the central market, according to an eyewitness who spoke to CNN.
Footage verified from social media illustrates the RSF’s advance; videos show armed fighters wearing the RSF’s hallmark tan camouflage and insignia capturing a militia outpost on the edge of the camp.
Then, less than half a kilometer south, fighters appear closer to the camp, perched atop pickup trucks with mounted belt-fed machine guns. The camera pans across the ground, littered with bullet casings, and briefly shows a plume of dark black smoke which appears to emanate from Zamzam’s central market.
The eyewitness described how the fighters set several shops ablaze before he fled the camp in terror.
“I saw people fleeing, and I was among them—some in their private vehicles and others on foot for hundreds of meters. Several stray bullets flew over our heads, and a victim fell right in front of me,” he recounted.
Dozens of children, women, and elderly people were killed and injured in the attacks, according to a statement released by Zamzam camp administrators on Thursday. The statement calls on the United Nations to deploy an international protection mission after “the [RSF] resorted to the scorched land policy, brutally targeting Zamzam.”
Satellite imagery shared by Maxar Technologies and footage posted on social media by North Darfur’s governor show the aftermath of large-scale burning throughout Zamzam’s central marketplace. Among the ash, remnants of the stands, chairs, and tables piled with charred vegetables can be seen.
Heat signatures recorded by NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System show that the fire ignited on Tuesday, causing damage thatHRL saysis “consistent with intentional razing” identified after nearby arson attacks perpetrated by the RSF.
The RSF did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for comment but characterized Zamzam camp as a “military garrison” in a statement posted to Telegram.
“We categorically affirm that no violations have occurred, and our forces have never targeted civilians. Rather, our forces operated with military professionalism, swiftly defeating the armed elements, seizing their weapons stockpiles, forcing them to flee the camp, and thwarting their plan to use civilians as human shields.”
The attack, which unfolded over two days, was launched weeks after the RSF began targeting the camp with long-range artillery in early December, according to aYale HRL report.
One video posted on Facebook by a spokesperson for the camp on December 18 shows the aftermath of a strike in central Zamzam. The footage, verified by CNN, shows the smoldering remains of three homes, which are difficult to make out against the singed earth.
While CNN was unable to recover imagery showing munitions fragments from the scene, Yale HRL researchersidentifiedRSF heavy artillery within firing range of the strike just days before the video surfaced. HRL’s findings are based on their review of satellite imagery following strikes on the camp.
The RSF claims that the camp is a “military base, housing weapons and ammunition depots as well as operations command rooms,” in the context of the paramilitary group’s wider offensive to capture al-Fasher — the last remaining bastion for government forces in North Darfur, according to Liam Karr, Africa team lead at the Institute for the Study of War. But these attacks on Zamzam extend “beyond military objectives into ethnic cleansing and genocide,” Karr says.
The RSF’s claim that its rivals are using refugees as human shields is a pretext “to indiscriminately target the hundreds of thousands of refugees in the camp as SAF sympathizers,” Karr told CNN.
Last month, former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkenaccusedthe RSF of committing genocide in Sudan, and imposed sanctions on its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti.
“We spent serious muscle pressuring the RSF to stop attacking Zamzam,” a former senior official told CNN. “Sadly, RSF leaders are savvy enough to realize that the new administration isn’t even paying attention.”
The RSF called the Biden Administration’s sanctions “regrettable and unjust” in a statement posted to Telegram, claiming that they were “politically motivated and… without an independent and thorough investigation.”
Zamzam has long been at the epicenter of the malnutrition crisis in Sudan. Last August, the World Food Programdeclaredthat the camp had been pushed into famine.
In the weeks before the RSF entered the camp, CNN gathered testimonies from residents and healthcare providers in Zamzam, which paint a stark image: parents going hungry to feed their children and whole families rationing small packets of Plumpy’Nut, a thick, peanut paste made to treat malnourished children.
One mother, holding her crying two-year-old child, explained the challenge of finding fresh water: “When we need water, we need to pay. And we don’t have money, so we ask Allah to sustain us,” she says.
About 34% of children living in Zamzam camp suffer from acute malnutrition—more than twice the emergency threshold—according to anMSF surveyconducted in the fall.
An eyewitness described to CNN the healthcare situation as “extremely dire” in the days before the RSF’s attacks this week.
Since the famine declaration, malnutrition has persisted and spread to two additional camps in North Darfur and the Western Nuba Mountains and is predicted to reach five additional localities in the state before May.
The RSF’s attacks on Zamzam have worsened the malnutrition crisis by forcing humanitarian groups like MSF to suspend certain aspects of their operations, MSF Secretary General Chris Lockyear told CNN after visiting the Darfur region in December.
Faced with continuing security threats, he says, “it’s simply too dangerous” to operate in certain areas of North Darfur. It is immediately unclear how this recent spate of violence will affect the malnutrition crisis in Zamzam.
“As the camp is surrounded [by RSF fighters], there is no possibility for the population to flee or for humanitarian aid to enter,” MSF’s Project Coordinator in North Darfur Marion Ramstein predicts. “People are left with nothing.”

UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Seif Magango told CNN that most of the 165 female prisoners who were raped by escaping male inmates died in the fire.
Between nine and 13 female inmates, “all of whom had also been raped,” survived the blaze, Magango added, citing a judicial source in the DRC.
“We did not independently verify the judicial official’s report ourselves, but we do consider his account to be credible,” Magango told CNN Thursday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/27/africa/morocco-sheep-slaughter-eid-intl/index.html,"King Mohammed VI ofMoroccoasked Moroccans on Wednesday to abstain from performing the rite of slaughtering sheep on Eid al-Adha this year due to a drop in the country’s herd following years of drought.
Eid al-Adha, to take place in June, commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim, or Abraham, to sacrifice his son on God’s command. Muslims mark the event by slaughtering sheep or goats. The meat is shared among family and donated to the poor.
Morocco’s cattle and sheep herds have decreased by 38% in 2025 since the last census nine years ago due to consecutive droughts, according to official figures.
“Our commitment to enabling you to fulfill this religious rite under the best conditions is accompanied by the duty to consider the climatic and economic challenges facing our country, which have led to a significant decline in livestock numbers,” the King said in a letter read on his behalf by religious affairs minister Ahmed Taoufiq on state TV Al Oula.
Performing the rite “under these difficult circumstances will cause significant harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,” said the King, Morocco’s supreme religious leader.
Rainfall was 53% lower this year than the average of the last 30 years, causing a lack of pasture for livestock to feed on. Meat production has dropped, leading to higher prices in the local market and higher imports of live cattle, sheep and red meat.
The country has recently signed a deal to import up to 100,000 sheep from Australia.
In its 2025 budget, Morocco suspended import duties and a value-added tax on cattle, sheep, camels and red meat to keep prices stable in the domestic market.",africa
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/africa/sudan-genocide-explained/index.html,"This week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan’s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide.
It’s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis.
For 20 months, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more.
The two men – former allies – jointlyousted President Omar al-Bashir from officein 2019. Together, they also contributed toanother coup in 2021when al-Burhan seized power from the country’s transitional government.
Today, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country’s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum.
More than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan.
Hunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti’s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated “direct attacks against civilians” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”
They also “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” Blinken said, adding that the same forces “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”
“Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,” he announced.
The RSF described the decision by the US as “unjust,” adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that “the State Department’s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.”
Related articleAt least 127, mostly civilians, killed in two days in Sudan bombardments
“The decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide … The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,” the RSF statement said.
The RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead.
Since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF,  ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide.
West Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups weremassacredby the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, “for his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,” and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual “for their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.”
In September last year, aUnited Nations fact-finding missionaccused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes.
And in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. “The United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,” he said. “Both belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.”
Sudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF.
In Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been “used as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,” – a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed.
“It’s the same method and strategy,” she said of the alleged sexual crimes. “It’s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.”
Al-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan’s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said.
“The RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,” she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti.
Civilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF – targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties.
Last month,more than 100 people were killedafter bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency’s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up “the deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,” the UN said.
Dozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF’s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October.
The RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking “widespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.”
CNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter buthas not yet received a response.
Before the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world’s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth.
Their war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures.
Some of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur’s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment.
Hunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people toeat “grass and peanut shells”to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger.
Food deliveries to Darfurresumed last Augustafter a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week.
On Friday, humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters.
“The medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,” MSF’s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement.
The Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year.
However, warring factions in the African nation have alsodefied global effortsto end the conflict.
Last month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were.
“To the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries – enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict – enough,” he said.
Sudan’s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE.
In a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: “The UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.”
ACNN investigationin 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time.
In November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan’s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan’s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia’s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan’s sovereignty.
Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US’ determination of genocide in Sudan was “long overdue” and should have happened sooner.
Nonetheless, it is “a form of justice because it recognizes victims’ grievances,” he said.
“It is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,” added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.
For activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors.
“We don’t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,” she said.
“So, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.”",africa

“I no longer line up for petrol on the road,” Belayneh, an Addis resident, told CNN. A full charge of his imported Toyota bZ4X – a popular EV in the country – “is more than enough for two days.”
Belayneh, who charges his car at home, is part of rapid transition to EVs in Addis Ababa, a fast-growing city in the horn of Africa at the center of Ethiopia’s goal to hoist millions of people out of poverty.
In addition to the polluting cars and trucks rumbling along the roads, cleaner — and quieter — vehicles are joining the traffic. Electric buses, smaller 15-seat minibuses, cars and motorbikes are popping up on the streets of the capital.
There arearound 100,000 EVsin Ethiopia so far.
The Ethiopian government estimates that numberwill more than quadrupleby 2032. That’s largely because the national government took the extraordinary step earlier this year of banning the import of allgas-powered passenger vehicles— becoming the first nation in the world to do so.
It also effectively slashed the customs tax on imported cars: The tax on gas vehicles was up to 200% before they were banned, while the import tax for fully assembled EVs is just 15%, according to the country’sfinance ministry.
It’s part of a government-led effort to get more EVs on the streets.
The lower rates are also spurring more local EV manufacturing. Hundreds of the vehicles were assembled by Ethiopia-based Belayneh Kindie Group using parts imported from China. Besufekad Shewaye, manager at the company, told CNN that import tariffs are “almost zero percent” for EV parts that are assembled in Ethiopia.
“Nowadays most vehicle owners prefer EVs, especially light vehicles,” Shewaye said. “The demand is increasing from day to day.”
Ethiopia is leaning hard into EVs in part because importing fuel is expensive, and 96% of the country’s electricitycomes from clean hydropower– a dual win for the country’s finances and the environment.
“They really are a clean-energy country,” said Jane Akumu, a Kenya-based program officer at the United Nations Environment Programme. “Why are you importing oil while you have local electricity that you can actually use for your vehicles?”
The government recognized it had a bountiful renewable energy source in the country when it started shifting towards EVs, said Assefa Hadis Hagos, a transportation adviser for the Ethiopian Ministry of Transport and Logistics.
Yet the total ban on gas-powered car imports, passed in January, took many in the region by surprise. “We didn’t know that the government was going to fully back a total ban,” Akumu said.
Ethiopia, which has for years been ruled by a one-party authoritarian government, has shown it can quickly implement environmental policies that would likely take longer in more democratic nations. In the early 2000s, the nation moved rapidly to ban inefficient and dangerous leaded gasoline.
“Other countries require more consultative process, more participation,” said Akumu, who also spearheaded the effort to eradicate leaded gasoline in Africa.
The number of cars on the road in Ethiopia is still quite low, about 1.2 million in total — or roughly one car for every 100 people. In the US,more than 91% of Americansown at least one car. In Africa’s most populous of country Nigeria, it’s11.8 million cars total, or between 5 and 6 cars per 100 people.
The Ethiopian government had kept car ownership rates low with its dramatically high taxes on gas-powered vehicles that cost consumers up to three times the value of car imports — part of an effort to get more people to use public transportation.

Even though the government has reduced or eliminated some of the taxes for imported EVs, buying an electric car is still expensive. “In terms of who is buying EVs, it’s definitely those in the high-income groups,” said Iman Abubaker, who is based in Ethiopia and works on sustainable transportation for the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit organization.
For this reason, Abubaker’s group and others are working to push the Ethiopian government and others around the continent to invest more in electric buses and public transport, so the efficient vehicles can be used by people of all income levels.
Despite the cost, Ethiopia’s vehicle fleet has seen a gradual but sustained rise in the number of EVs displacing combustion engine cars. Within two years of the country’s 10-year goal to bring in more than 100,000 EVs — started in 2022 — EVs already account for nearly 10% of its vehicles, according toCleanTechnica.
Ethiopia’s government “feels good” about the pace of the transition, Hagos, the transportation advisor, told CNN. He added the government has a “commitment” to reducing climate and environmental pollution from gas cars.
For now, Ethiopia stands alone in its ban of imported gas cars. The country’s ban is “definitely a one-off,” said Moses Nderitu, the Kenya managing director of electric bus company BasiGo.
But EV growth around the continent is happening even without such bans. In Nairobi, Kenya, electric motorbikes are seeing startling growth. Last year, Uberrolled out a fleetof eye-catching yellow motorbikes – known locally as boda bodas.
After the Kenyan government passed tax incentives, there was a 500% jump in electric motorbikes on the road in a single year, industry experts told CNN, going from the low hundreds to about 3,000 bikes on the streets of Nairobi.
That number is still a small fraction of the 200,000 total bikes on Nairobi’s streets, but it has already helped cut down on noise pollution in parts of the city, said Hezbon Mose, the Kenya country director for e-bike company Ampersand, which has fleets of bikes in both Kenya and Rwanda.
In the Ethiopian capital, stricter measures, which include thenon-issuance of licenses for fuel-run motorbikes,have been implemented by the city’s authorities who approved a timeline in April for gasoline motorcycles to be converted to electric-powered models.
Earlier in March, the city introduced itsfirst fleet of electric busesfor public transit.
American-style electric public buses — more drab than the colorful and music playing gas-poweredmatatubuses in Kenya — are also starting to be driven more on Nairobi streets.
Both Mose and Nderitu see EVs on the rise across the continent, as some countries look to get off oil in favor of cheaper electricity. Much more infrastructure and government subsidies are needed in many countries to get more people to go electric.
“I look at electric vehicles exactly as we looked at the mobile telephone market 30 years ago,” Nderitu told CNN. “When the rest of the world started adopting mobile phones, there was no infrastructure (in Africa). There was a very small amount of people who were connected to phones. Today you look at Nairobi, you hardly find anybody without a phone.”

https://edition.cnn.com/science/giant-african-rat-wildlife-traffickers-spc/index.html,"While the jury is still out on whether or not the African giant pouched rat is cute, it’s harder to deny the impressive power of its nose.
Tanzania-based non-profit APOPO has already demonstrated the ability of the cat-sized rodents, which it calls “HeroRATs,” to sniff outlandmines, tuberculosis, and even survivors among rubble innatural disasterzones.
But now the organization is turning its attention (and its rats’ noses) to the global illegal wildlife trade.
Estimated to be worth up to$23 billion per year, illicit wildlife trafficking is the fourth largest illegal trade industry worldwide –following counterfeit products, drugs and humans.
“Wildlife is deemed to be a low-risk commodity,” says Crawford Allan, vice president of nature crimes and policy advocacy at the WWF US, who has over 30 years’ experience working on wildlife crime. “Unfortunately, organized crime knows there’s a real weak spot in detection methods of ports, seaports and airports, particularly in Africa.”
Traffickers disguise wildlife products in a whole host of ways, he explains. Ivory, for example, might be stained to look like wood, hidden within crop shipments and even cut up into chocolate bar-shaped pieces, coated in chocolate and wrapped up in the packaging – all in an attempt slip past visual and X-ray inspections.
This is where the rats and their acute sense of smell come in. According tonew researchled by APOPO and published in Frontiers in Conservation Science, the rats have been successfully trained in a research facility to sniff out elephant tusks, rhino horns, pangolin scales and African blackwood – which Allan, who’s not involved in the research, says are some of the most common wildlife products to be trafficked out of Africa.
Dr. Izzy Szott, the behavioral research scientist leading the project, suggests using rats as a “complementary tool” to dogs, which are already used to detect wildlife contraband. “Dogs are amazing. If you are looking at tracking through the Serengeti (a national park in Tanzania), you’re not going to use a rat for that,” she says. However, being “very small and agile,” rats have the upper hand in a densely packed shipping container, she explains.
Unlike dogs, the rats are happy to work with multiple handlers and, largely owing to their smaller size, are much cheaper to train, maintain, and transport, claims Szott. This is particularly important given that much of the illicit wildlife trade comes from some of the world’s poorest regions.
Allan identifies cost as the major issue in detecting trafficked wildlife products, asserting that “we need to find some cheaper, more sustainable solutions for detection in Africa.” He adds that improving detection methods increases the risk for illegal wildlife traders – which, in turn, drives up commercial prices and shrinks demand. “I’m hopeful that (using rats) for detecting wildlife will be a low cost, (high) impact, low footprint operation,” says Allan.
Kate Webb, an assistant professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University, in North Carolina, and one of the lead authors of the study, tells CNN that one of the the biggest advantages of using rats is their relatively short training time. “There has also been interest in wildlife detection rats from Singapore and France,” she added.
Trialing these research findings in the real world, APOPO last year conducted a proof-of-concept study at the seaport of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, which handles95%of the country’s international trade. APOPO says the rats found over83%of planted targets, even when items were concealed by regularly used scent-masking products. Once a rat identifies a target, it alerts its handler by using its front paws to pull a little ball attached to a custom-made, neoprene vest, which triggers a beeping sound.
The illegal wildlife trade not only impacts populations of the trafficked animal or plant, it can have devastating knock-on consequences for whole ecosystems.Studies suggestthat the consumption of illegally traded wildlife can also lead to the spread of zoonotic diseases, such as the Ebola virus, monkeypox virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
African giant pouched rats have an average lifespan of around eight years, so training them for one year is a worthwhile long-term investment, says Szott. The year consists of Monday through Friday training sessions, regularly interspersed with playtime in a big outdoor kennel filled with rope toys and running wheels.
The rats’ high level of intelligence and curiosity makes them good students, she explains: “If you need to get them to do something new, you just drop them in there (into a training enclosure) and wait for them to figure it out.”
Like people, each rat has a different character, she adds: “You have animals that might get it in the first try and you might have animals that take a little time, but then become the absolute superstars once they figure it out.”
Though this research is still in its early stages, APOPO is hopeful that it will scale up in a similar way to its previous projects. The team intends to carry out further operational trials with the trained rats at Dar es Salaam’s seaport and airport. The next steps will focus on optimizing deployment strategies – looking at the performance of the rats when on long leads versus free-roaming, says Szott.
She is confident the rats are up to the challenge. “So far, whatever we’ve thrown at the rats, they’ve been doing it,” she says. “If we communicate it right to the rats, they’ve always been up to the task.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/22/americas/migrants-deported-camp-panama-intl-latam/index.html,"For days, they say they were locked inside a hotel in Panama, surrounded by tight security with limited contact with the outside world.
Nearly 300 migrants from Asia, all deported by the US, were held there by Panamanian authorities who agreed to take them in and eventually repatriate them. It’s part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, which it haspressured Latin American nationsto help with.
Some migrants have been transferred to a remote camp at the edge of a jungle that few can access, lawyers representing some of the migrants told CNN. Now, they wait to learn if they will be sent back to the countries they fled or to another nation willing to receive them.
But the conditions they have faced are distressing and may have violated their rights, the lawyers said.
The migrants started arriving in Panama City last week after being deported from the US. Some didn’t even know they were being flown to another country until they actually landed in Panama, according to attorney Ali Herischi, who said “they were told they’re going to Texas.”
The migrants were then sent to the Decapolis Hotel and forced to stay there for days without stepping foot outside.
Jenny Soto Fernández, a Panamanian lawyer who represents about 24 migrants from India and Iran, said her clients were living in isolation, fear and uncertainty.
She said a lot of them didn’t know their rights and weren’t given orders of removal upon being deported. They also face language barriers and are constantly worried about being repatriated, she added.
One of the migrants is Artemis Ghasemzadeh, an Iranian national who fled her country out of fear of persecution because of her conversion to Christianity.
“Under Islamic law, you cannot convert from Islam to any other religion,” said Herischi, who represents her.
Ghasemzadeh now worries her life will be at risk if she’s returned to Iran.
“We are in danger,” she said in text messages to CNN on Tuesday. “We are waiting for (a) miracle.”
At the hotel, some migrants tried to voice their concerns by sending distress signals to journalists gathered outside. Standing in front of their windows, they held up pieces of paper with handwritten notes begging for support.
“Please help us,” one sign read. “We are not (safe) in our country.”
Another message was written with lipstick directly on the window. “HELP US,” it read in bold, red letters.
The migrants were not allowed to leave the hotel “for their own protection,” Panama’s Security Minister Frank Ábrego told a local radio program on Wednesday. He said they were held at the hotel, in part, because officials needed to “effectively verify who these people are who are arriving in our country.”
Soto argues that the migrants have the right to seek asylum because they’re fleeing persecution.
“These people that are requesting refugee (status) — it’s not because they want to come here on an adventure or a trip. No, they’re escaping. They’re victims of violence and persecution,” she told CNN.
Soto said she tried at least four times to meet her clients at the hotel to sign legal documents required by authorities but was blocked by officials and never made it past the lobby.
Soto sent CNN a video filmed by her clients, showing her waving to them from the hotel staircase below, trying to reach them to hand them the paperwork. But the clients were prevented from going down and Soto was told to leave.
“They actually were so emotional, screaming and said, ‘I want my lawyer! I want her. I want to talk to her. I don’t want to talk to these people here,’” Soto said.
Attorney Susana Sabalza told CNN she represents a family from Taiwan who was held at the hotel for five days without knowing what was happening.
She said that while they had comfortable beds and a place to stay, they were under “psychological pressure being closed in with security guards, immigration police, (and) officers there.”

CNN has reached out to Panama’s security ministry, as well as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), who are involved in the repatriation efforts.
Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino on Thursday denied that authorities have violated any laws.
“These organizations are respectful of human rights. It’s false and I deny that we are mistreating them,” Mulino insisted.
Security Minister Ábrego said Wednesday that he hadn’t heard of any migrants requesting asylum there.
“But if they think they have the need, as any human being would, to request asylum, we have to pay attention to it and approve or disapprove it,” he added.
CNN has reached out to Panama’s National Office for Refugee Assistance to determine if anyone has filed an asylum claim.
The Panamanian government said that from Tuesday to Wednesday, about 97 migrants were taken out of the hotel and bused to a remote holding camp on the outskirts of theDarién Jungle. It happened after a New York Times report exposed the desperation of those stranded in the hotel in Panama City.
The miracle that Ghasemzadeh had hoped for didn’t come. Hours after talking to CNN, she became one of those transferred to the camp. Her relatives said she learned late Tuesday night that she would be moved out of the hotel with about 12 other people, and that she didn’t know where authorities would take her at the time.
Herischi, who represents Ghasemzadeh and nine other refugees, told CNN that his clients ended up being detained in a “very bad” camp.
He said they described the site as tough and dirty, with limited access to medication and the internet.
One family has a sick child who could be heard crying in the background during a call between Herischi and Panamanian officials.
Sabalza said the family she represents was also taken to the camp.
“It’s complicated because there are children five years old (and) it’s a tropical place,” she told CNN.
She said Panamanian authorities had not yet provided them with guidelines on how the attorneys would be able to visit their clients at the camp or if they would need special permits to enter.
“It is urgent for us to have clarity about the mental and physical health status of our (clients),” she said.
When the migrants arrived at the gate on Wednesday morning, Herischi said the situation was so unorganized that the guards didn’t even have a list of the migrants’ names to identify them upon arrival. The guards later confiscated all the migrants’ cell phones.
“It shows that (it’s) such an unorganized and never-thought-of (situation,) and just ad hoc political decision to accept this, but they don’t know what to do with them,” he told CNN.

He added that he plans to file legal action against Panama and the US in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and US federal court.
More than 100 migrants have asked not to be repatriated, Panamanian officials have said.
The IOM is expected to work with them and try to find a third country that will accept them, Security Minister Ábrego said.
Meanwhile, President Mulino said another group of migrants would be sent to the camp because “that’s where they can be more at ease.”
He added that 175 migrants who are still in the hotel have voluntarily agreed to return to their countries of origin. At least 13 have already been sent back.
Herischi said Panamanian authorities assured him they would not send Ghasemzadeh and other migrants back to Iran if they expressed fear of reprisals. Instead, officials said they would speak with the embassies of other countries to see if they can accept them.
Herischi concluded, “The only ‘luck’ that they got is that Panama has no relationship with Iran, so there is no Iranian embassy there.”
“That’s a good thing.”",americas
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/22/americas/us-cartels-terrorist-explainer-latam-intl/index.html,"Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and the Sinaloa cartel are among the two gangs and six drug cartels the US has officially designated as foreign terrorist organizations, fulfilling along-standing goalfrom US President Donald Trump’s first term in office.
Trump previously ordered the US to declare cartels terrorist groups in aJanuary 20 executive order, but until US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’sofficial announcementon Thursday, none of the cartels had been specifically named. During his first term, Trump had considered a similar maneuver but refrained at the request of then-Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
In an order published in the federal government’s Public Register, Rubio named two gangs: Tren de Aragua of Venezuela and MS-13 of El Salvador; and six Mexican drug cartels: Cartel de Sinaloa, Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion, Carteles Unidos, Cartel del Noreste, Cartel del Golfo, and La Nueva Familia Michoacana.
They join the ranks of other groups designated asforeign terrorist organizationsby the US, including ISIS, Boko Haram, and Hamas.
Here’s what you need to know about each of these groups:
Tren de Aragua began as a prison gang in Venezuela, according to theUS Treasury Department, with much of their criminal enterprise focused “on human smuggling and other illicit acts that target desperate migrants.”
Also known as TdA, the group today has a presence far beyond its original stomping grounds. Óscar Naranjo, a former vice president of Colombia and chief of the Colombian National Police,told CNNin 2024 that Tren de Aragua is “the most disruptive criminal organization operating nowadays in Latin America.”
TdA became a political talking point during the last presidential campaign, after police in Aurora, Colorado, said several suspects in a 2023 kidnapping there were members of the gang. As he stumped for the presidency, Trump held up Aurora and Tren de Aragua as an example of what he said were migration’s inevitable results,claimingthat the gang had taken control of vast swathes of territory in Colorado. Aurora police, however, pushed back, saying that the gang’s presence in the city was “isolated.”
For Trump, “cracking down on Tren de Aragua is part and parcel of cracking down on the era of mass migration,” said Will Freeman, a Latin America fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a Salvadoran-American street gang and criminal organization, notorious for itsbrutalityand its deep roots in the United States. MS-13 was a prominent theme of Trump’s first term, with the president often referring to the group as “violent animals.”
Unlike any of the other groups listed in Rubio’s order, MS-13 is technically native to the US. According toa historyof MS-13 from InSight Crime, a think tank focused on organized crime in Latin America, a group of Salvadorans originally founded the group in 1980s Los Angeles.
In the following years, MS-13 began to grow and evolve as more Salvadorans arrived in the US, fleeingthe civil warback home. Though the group began as a Salvadoran gang, according toa 2008 FBI threat assessment, its ranks have opened to others from Latin America, including Hondurans and Guatemalans. When US authorities began deporting members of MS-13 back to the region in the 1990s, it caused anexplosion of gang activityin El Salvador and neighboring countries.
By 2015, El Salvador was themurder capitalof the Western Hemisphere. Ten years later,  however, the murder rate has plummeted. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has focused much of his time in office oncurbing violence from gangs like MS-13, arresting nearly 1% of the country’s population and throwing thousands of gang members in prison.
MS-13’s addition to the designation list is a “curveball,” said Freeman.
“It’s a bit weird,” Freeman pointed out. “One of the main countries it drew its strength from was El Salvador. It’s really been dismantled there.”
The Cartel de Sinaloa or the Sinaloa Cartel is closely associated with its former leader Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, known for his numerous prison escapes and immortalized in rapper Gucci Mane’s 2012 single “El Chapo.” After the US extradited Guzmán from Mexico in 2017 and convicted him on 10 counts of federal drug-related crimes two years later, his sons – El Chapitos - partly took control of the group. The DEA alleged in a 2024National Drug Threat Assessmentthat the Sinaloa Cartel operates with four different components cooperating without a single, formal leader.
According to theCouncil on Foreign Relations, the Sinaloa Cartel’s international presence is unmatched by any other Mexican criminal group, with a diverse empire of extortion rackets, weapons trading, prostitution and oil theft alongside their drug business. In 2023, former US Attorney General Merrick Garlandallegedthe Sinaloa Cartel operates the “largest, most violent, and most prolific fentanyl trafficking operation in the world.”  In the same press release, the Justice Department alleged that the group is “largely responsible” for the manufacturing and importing of fentanyl for distribution in the US.
Known as the Gulf Cartel, or by its acronym CDG, the Cartel del Golfo is based in Matamoros, Mexico, just over the border from Brownsville, Texas. Authorities in Mexico and the US believe that CDG was responsible for thehighly-publicized kidnapping of four American touristsin Matamoros in 2023. Two of the victims died during the incident, which one US official told CNN was likely a case ofmistaken identity.
Journalist Ioan Grillowritesin his authoritative book “El Narco” that the Gulf Cartel got its start during the Prohibition era, smuggling heroin and whiskey over the border into the US. But it wasn’t until the 1990s and 2000s that CDG reached prominence under the stewardship of Osiel Cardenas Guillen.
Cardenas, whom Grillo describes as a “balding former car thief,” eventually enticed members of the Mexican Special Forces to join his syndicate as enforcers. Their unit eventually (and violently) branched off into Los Zetas Cartel in 2010, according to a 2022reportfrom the Congressional Research Service. Cardenas, meanwhile, was arrested and extradited to the US in 2007, where he was imprisoned. In 2024, the UShanded him overto Mexico so he could stand trial on numerous charges there.
The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, is one of the “most powerful and ruthless criminal organizations” inside Mexico, according to the DEA’s 2024 National Drug Threat Assessment.
CJNG is led by Nemesio Oseguero Cervantes, a former police officer better known as El Mencho,accordingto InSight Crime. A Justice Departmentindictmentof Oseguero says  his organization is active in the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Veracruz, and has presences elsewhere.
The DEA alleges that the cartel “operates under a franchise business model,” allowing CJNG to rapidly expand and control significant swathes of narcotrafficking routes. Heavily involved in the production and trafficking of methamphetamine and fentanyl, the DEA claims that CJNG has deep connections with suppliers for chemical precursors in China. Jalisco exercises control over various maritime ports to import these chemical products and has an extensive network of smuggling routes.
In its latest incarnation, Cárteles Unidos formed in 2019 as an alliance of the Cartel of Tepalcatepec, Los Viagras, and other groups, with the shared goal of combatting CJNG and expelling them from Michoacán, according to InSight Crime.
Before disbanding, a prior version of the group formed in 2010 to stop the advance of the Zetas into Michoacán and Jalisco, InSight reports. It was composed of members from many organizations from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Knights Templar cartel, Milenio Cartel, and the Familia Michoacana.
The broader organization isled byJuan José Farías Álvarez, known as “El Abuelo,” the former leader of the self-defense group that fought the Knights Templar in Tierra Caliente. Carteles Unidos also is involved in growing avocados, one of Mexico’s chief exports. The cartel devotes significant energy to extorting avocado producers, andone recent reportfound that 80% of the avocado orchards in Michoacan were established illegally.
The Cartel del Noreste (CDN) operates primarily in northeast Mexico along the US border. The cartel emerged when Los Zetas – itself a spinoff of the Gulf Cartel - splintered after a series of high-profile leadership losses, according toInSight Crime.
A 2024 Justice Departmentindictmentagainst several members of the organization accused CDN and Los Zetas of “using terroristic violence to control large swaths of Northern Mexico, including along the border between Mexico and the United States.”
In November 2024, Homeland Securitysaid that the groupwas involved in smuggling migrants into the US, claiming that “in recent years it has added human smuggling to its list of illicit money-making operations, with Facebook and social media becoming invaluable tools to facilitate its new venture.”
According to the US Treasury, La Nueva Familia Michoacana isled by José Alfredo and Johnny Hurtado Olascoagawitha presencein Michoacán, Guerrero, and the state of Mexico. The US State Department has alleged that the organization is involved in “migrant smuggling” into the US, alongside the fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine trades.
The group’s founder, Nazario “El Chayo” Moreno, was known for preaching Bible verses and self-help phrases to the members of his organization, according to the Mexican attorney general’s office.Moreno famously “died” twice: Mexican authorities initially claimed they killed him in 2010 but couldn’t produce an image of his dead body. The official story drew suspicion up through 2014, when Mexico’s Public Security System said he was shot and killed during a raid, acknowledging their previous announcement was incorrect.",americas
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/americas/chile-humpback-whale-kayaker-intl-latam/index.html,"A humpbackwhale brieflyswallowed a 24-year-old kayaker last Saturday during a father-son excursion out on the icy waters around Chile’s southernmost Patagonia region.
The terrifying moment, captured on camera by the kayaker’s father, showed the whale surfacing in the Strait of Magellan and gulping Adrian Simancas for a few moments before releasing him.
In the video, verified by CNN, Adrian’s father, Dell, is heard yelling to his son, who had been spat out of the whale, to “grab the boat.” Adrian then swims towards his dad’s pack raft and holds onto it as they pull away.
“I thought it swallowed me,” Adrian said in the video.
Speaking to CNN en Español, Adrian explained what it felt like to be briefly engulfed by a humpback whale.
“When I turned around, I felt on my face like a slimy texture; I saw colors like dark blue, white, something approaching from behind that closed… and sank me,” he said. “At that moment, I thought there was nothing I could do, that I was going to die, I didn’t know what it was.”

But despite the uncertainty, he felt his life vest “pull me up, and then two seconds later I was back on the surface and then started understanding what happened,” he said.
Dell told CNN en Español he began recording when he noticed “pretty waves that seemed exciting.”
He then heard “what sounds like a strong wave hitting behind me and when I turn around, I don’t see Adrian or his pack raft, so I got worried, and around three seconds later I see he’s shot up to the surface and the pack raft after him.”
When asked if both father and son would go back to kayaking, they said in chorus: “Of course.”
Wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta said the humpback whale was likely lunge-feeding on krill or fish at the time, and the kayaker was in its way.
“The gentleman happened to be very close to the whale that was just going about feeding behavior. The man was not swallowed,” she said.
“These animals are not targeting human-sized prey. They don’t have the equipment to do what they need to do in order to devour a human,” she said, pointing to their narrow esophagus and lack of teeth.
The Strait of Magellan is a popular tourist destination due to its outdoor activities and flora and fauna. Kayaking with dolphins and humpback whales is one of the activities advertised on the government’s tourismwebsite.
Humpback whales live throughout the world’s major oceans,according to the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
The NOAA says humpback whales are popular among whale watchers as they are active on the surface and often jump out and slap the water with their pectoral fins or tails.",americas

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/americas/venezuela-migrants-colombia-cali-aid-freeze-intl-latam/index.html,"The sewing machines and computers sit collecting dust in the dark. They were once tools of hope and empowerment, a promise for those seeking to build a life for themselves.
This abandoned workshop is no ordinary factory. It is a vocational school in Cali, southwest Colombia, run by local contractors of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and was once a route for Venezuelan migrants like Alexandra Guerra to develop the skills to join the shoemaking industry.
The school offered the 25-year-old single mother of two a way to provide for her children, younger sister, and mother. USAID was even going to pay Guerra a daily subsidy while she looked for work.
But she saw her hopes crushed when the White House halted foreign aid last month. Her classroom was shuttered. Courses ceased. And the prospects of staying in Colombia looked bleak once again.
US President Donald Trump’s sweeping changes to foreign assistance led to the rapid dismantling of USAID. A freeze was put on foreign aid, USAID staffers worldwide were recalled, and several were placed on leave in the president’s apparent attempt to shut down the agency — whichhe had declareda waste of money.
But in Latin America, USAID had helped create economic opportunities for people like Guerra, according to the agency’s websitebefore it was taken offline, giving migrants a degree of stability and, often, a reason to stay.
Its proponents say USAID helped curb migration at its root – the same phenomenon the Trump administration wants to stop withpolicieslike mass deportations from the US, ICE raids, and reinforcement at the southern border.
Gustavo Vivas, the project director of the USAID program Guerra was enrolled in, says the new policy of cuts is contradictory.
“It is curious that a solution to many problems — including those related to migration — is being halted,” he told CNN, sitting in an IT classroom that’s been left unused since January 27. He added that their programs help to “prevent more Venezuelans from attempting to reach the United States.”
Home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population in the world, Colombia is full of people with stories like Guerra’s.
In 2019, she left her village in Cojedes, Venezuela, and her family behind, making the trek to Colombia on foot. She was able to reunite with her family a year later after they joined her amid the pandemic lockdowns.
Last year, Guerra applied to the Safe Mobility Program as she set her sights on migrating to the United States legally.
Programs like Safe Mobility wereBiden administrationinitiatives to offer legal routes for migrants in difficult situations to relocate safely in the US, such as Venezuelans and Nicaraguans fleeing authoritarian regimes.

But Guerra’s hopes were dashed when the program was shut down and her application was suspended last month, just a week before her classes were cancelled.
She has instead set her sights on migrating to Europe – where she would have to make the journey alone once again while her sons, aged four and eight, stay behind with their grandmother.
“Regardless that it’s not going to be the US, any country will do,” she said. “I want to work and earn enough to open my own business in Venezuela, one day… Right now, I’m a candidate for a job at an Italian airport. My doubt was that because Safe Mobility had shut, maybe the other [non-US] programs would also shut,” she said.
Guerra isn’t likely to be the only migrant in Colombia with dreams of leaving the country.
Colombian officials say closing USAID will push even more people to migrate as their country was one of the largest recipients of US aid funds in the world, with more than 82 programs worth almost $2 billion currently suspended because of Trump’s order.
Other migrants, like Ayarith Olimpio, find themselves stuck in the aftermath of the aid freeze. They spoke to CNN about being unable to relocate and unable to foster the community they worked so hard to build.
She credits the team at the Cali vocational center for providing guidance through psychologists, advisors and mentors to support her beyond the classroom.
“Here, this center becomes the family network that can help you out. Maybe a friend you make at work, maybe a street neighbor you meet here,” she told CNN.
Yet, almost five years after settling down in Cali, Olimpio hasn’t given up the dream of moving to another country that could offer more opportunities than Colombia. Moving to the US is on the cards, but Olimpio says she would only do it via legal channels.
She told CNN she wants Americans to accept her and understand the value she and other migrants could bring to the US.
“A migrant is not just a face on social media, we are people!” she said, tears welling in her eyes while pointing out that many Venezuelans are fleeing disastrous economic conditions and brutal repression back home.
“Immigrants don’t leave their country just because they want to,” she explained.
It’s not just migrants who are at the receiving end of the gutting of USAID. Colombian aid workers employed by US-funded programs have also found their lives upended.
Aid workers in Colombia assigned to USAID-funded programs told CNN they are seeing their contracts terminated.
One aid worker described an email she received from her employer, an NGO, announcing the suspension of US funding for her program.
“In the email they said: ‘We understand you have questions, and most likely we don’t have answers for them…’ I think that sums everything up pretty well: nobody knows anything other than the funding has been frozen,” said the aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of possible repercussions.
At the shuttered Cali vocational center, Olimpio says it saddens her to know others cannot access what USAID offered her. These are people who she says: “literally depend on what they learn.”
“There are people right now who are waiting for their opportunity, just like I waited and got it,” she said. “They don’t know if they’ll get it.",americas
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/20/americas/mexico-national-sovereignty-sheinbaum-intl-latam/index.html,"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she’ll propose reforms to the country’s constitution aiming to reinforce the nation’s sovereignty, after the US designated several Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations – a move that could potentially lay the groundwork for direct US strikes inside Mexican territory.
“The people of Mexico, under no circumstances will accept interventions, interference or any other act from abroad that is harmful to the integrity, independence and sovereignty of the nation,” Sheinbaum said Thursday during her daily press conference.
The measures would apply to the entire Mexican territory including “land, water, sea or airspace,” she added.
The US has been covertly flying MQ-9 Reaper drones inside Mexican airspace to spy on drug cartels, CNN recently reported, as part of Trump’s dramatic reorientation of national security assets to the US southern border.
Sheinbaum and other senior Mexican officials have previously emphasized concerns over sovereignty following revelations that US spy plane flights are also occurring near the border, albeit in international airspace and over US territory. Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla said last week that he had not been given a heads up on the spy plane flights.
Sheinbaum is now proposing reforms to constitutional articles 39 and 40, whichfocuson Mexico’s independence and sovereignty.
The proposed reforms include Mexico prohibiting any “intervention for investigations and prosecutions without the express authorization and collaboration of the Mexican state within the framework of the applicable laws.”

Sheinbaum also said that the US decision to designate certain criminal groups in Mexico as terrorist organizations was not undertaken in consultation with her government.
“What we want to make clear with this designation is that we do not negotiate sovereignty, this can’t be an opportunity by the United States to invade our sovereignty,” the president said.
“They can call (cartels) whatever they decide, but with Mexico it is collaboration and coordination, never subordination, no interference and even less invasion.”
Separately, Sheinbaum said she is also proposing another reform to target “any national or foreigner involved in the illicit manufacture, distribution, disposal, transfer and internment of weapons into the national territory.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/18/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-charged-coup-plot-intl-latam/index.html,"Brazil’sformer President Jair Bolsonaro has been charged in connection with analleged coup plotto overturn the results of the 2022 election and keep his opponent from taking power, according to documents filed by prosecutors Tuesday evening.
Bolsonaro was among 34 people facing charges including those of armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d’état, and damage qualified by violence.
Prosecutors allege that the plot began in 2021, with an effort to undermine public trust in electronic voting machines.
In 2022, Bolsonaro allegedly met with ambassadors and diplomatic representatives to discuss the accusations of voting fraud “in an attempt to prepare the international community for disrespecting the popular will in the presidential elections,” a statement from the Attorney General’s Office read.
Despite finding no evidence of election fraud, the defendants allegedly continued their campaign to discredit the electoral system, prosecutors said.
They also allege that Bolsonaro approved a plan to carry out the coup, which they say included the death of the elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his vice president.
Prosecutors said the last attempt to overturn the election happened onJanuary 8, 2023, when defendants allegedly encouraged groups of Bolsonaro supporters to mobilize in Brasília, where they stormed and vandalized the three seats of government.
Related articleBrazil’s Bolsonaro and allies indicted in 2022 coup plot probe
In November, Bolsonaro and 36 others were indicted as part of an investigation into the alleged coup plot.
The charges, brought before the Supreme Court in Brasília, could set the stage for a high-profile trial. If the charges are formally accepted by the Supreme Court, those charged will formally become defendants.
To prevent the case from influencing Brazil’s 2026 presidential elections, Supreme Court justices are pushing to conclude the trial before the end of 2025, but it is unlikely the court will announce its decision on whether to take on the case or schedule preliminary hearings before early March.
In the 844-page November indictment, federal police accused Bolsonaro of having “full knowledge” of the alleged coup plan to prevent Lula from taking office, adding that the former president “planned, acted in, and led directly and effectively” the plan.
Later on Tuesday after the charges had been filed, Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing, telling journalists he had “no concerns about the accusations, zero.”
“Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven’t. Neither have I,” he told journalists during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia, according to CNN Brasil.
According to CNN Brasil, the former president has been in Brasilia attempting to negotiate a potential amnesty deal.
If found guilty, Bolsonaro could potentially face up to 28 years in prison, according to CNN Brasil.
In 2023, Bolsonaro was banned from public office for eight years after a separate investigation into alleged abuse of power found him guilty of spreading misinformation about the integrity of the Brazilian election apparatus to foreign governments.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/americas/canada-liberal-party-leader-election-intl-latam/index.html,"The race is underway to replace Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Frontrunners to lead Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party, including the internationally recognizable Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, are making the case they can guide Canada through numerous domestic and international issues, including mounting trade tensions with the United States.
Following a series of political crises last year, Trudeau announced in January he would resign as Liberal leader once his replacement is chosen – and eventually hand over the Prime Minister’s office as well.
This Sunday, Liberals finally tally the votes and announce their new leader, all as Canada’s general elections loom later this year. Here is what you need to know:
Trudeau has led the party for over a decade. He took the Liberalsto power in 2015, promising “sunny ways” for Canada and was elected two more times since then, most recently in 2021, when he remained in power but lost his governing majority.
He championed progressive issues like combating climate change and addressing historic abuses against Indigenous peoples, but the latter years of his premiership have been marked by rising economic discontent. His administration was also rocked last year by the surprise resignation of Freeland, who was then deputy prime minister and finance minister, just hours before she was due to deliver her annual fiscal update.
Trudeau is stepping down ahead of a major challenge to the Liberal party’s rule, with general elections expected by October. Liberals have been polling poorly against their Conservative rivals, helmed by right-wing firebrand Pierre Poilievre. But in recent weeks, the opposition lead has narrowed as Trudeau’s potential successors, like Carney, take strong, public stances on the ongoing trade dispute with the United States.
Though Trudeau will step down as Liberal leader following Sunday’s vote, he has not given an exact date to relinquish power as prime minister. The next Liberal prime minister will be able request new federal elections within days, weeks, or months.
Relations with the US have soured under the Trump administration. The past three months have seen US President Donald Trump blame Canada for illegalimmigrationinto the US, threaten to turn Canada into the US’s51st state,and impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports, which the White House says is necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.

Rhetoric traded between Trump and Trudeau has galvanized feelings of nationalism among some Canadians; at NHL and NBA games in Canada, fans have even been booing the US National Anthem. The cross-border tensions may also have put some wind in the sails of the Liberal party, as Conservative leader Poilievre – who has previously been compared to Trump – seeks to distance himself from the US leader, reiterating at a Tuesday press conference thathe is “not MAGA.”
“Canadian politics is being convulsed by the Trump government’s assertions about Canada’s future as he saw it, and secondly by the tariffs that were very puzzling to a lot of people given the depth of interdependence between the Canadian and American economies,” Allan Tupper, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia, told CNN.
Whoever takes the mantle from Trudeau will have to be a tough negotiator, “particularly on tariffs,” Tupper added. “It just may be a different kind of Canada to deal with, it’s going to be more assertive, more nationalistic and more in charge of its destiny.”
Mark Carney:Among the race’s frontrunners is Carney, a former governor of both the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. Drawing on his finance background, Carney has made clean energy, climate policies and economic prosperity for Canada some of the central facets of his campaign.
When launching his campaign, Carney highlighted his role in helping the Canadian government address its debt during the 2008 financial crisis and his role in navigating Britain’s economy through Brexit. He has also called for bringing economic prosperity to Canada with the help of its natural resources and making Canada a leader in clean energy.
Experts say Carney has received backing from Liberal lawmakers and even Trudeau’s cabinet, and his economics experience could make him the man for the moment.
“He’s very competent in economics, so with these tariffs, this economic war, a lot of people are supporting him,” said Charles-Etienne Beaudy, political science professor at the University of Ottawa and author of “Radio Trump: How he won the first time.”
Carney, like the other candidates, has not shied away from questions on how to tackle the Trump administration, tellingCNN in Februarythat despite being “insulted on multiple occasions by senior members of the administration. We are not going to reciprocate in those insults.”
Since the US tariffs were announced last month, Carney has been an outspoken proponent of dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs that would hit the US hard but have minimal impact on Canada.
Chrystia Freeland:The former journalist, who is the other frontrunner in Sunday’s vote, became one of Trudeau’s most well-known cabinet members before she resigned.
Born to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, Freeland studied at Harvard University before going on to work as a journalist covering Russia and Ukraine for several years. She entered politics in 2013, rising through the ranks of the Liberal Party and gaining several cabinet posts under Trudeau’s administration.
Notably, she’s dealt with Trump on trade before. As foreign minister in 2018, she helped Canadarenegotiatethe free trade deal between Canada, the US and Mexico, which Trump has indicated he wants to renegotiate yet again. She also engaged in high-profile clashes with the US during the first Trump administration over its decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada. She has since become a personal target for Trump, who hascriticized heras “totally toxic and not at all conducive to making deals.”
A once-staunch Trudeau ally, Freeland’sresignation in Decembermarked the beginning of the collapse of Trudeau’s government.

On the campaign trail, Freeland has hinted at taking a harder line on immigration and has advocated for a tough approach to the US with targeted retaliatory tariffs.
Karina Gould:Gould is the youngest woman to serve as a minister in the country. She branded herself as “part of a generational shift” in Canada as she launched her campaign in January, underscoring that the Liberal Party “needs to embrace this shift too.”
Gould has also proposed an increase in corporate taxes on large companies earning more than $500 million a year, to encourage them to reinvest into business and productivity, or face an increased corporate tax.
Gould has made clear that her priority, if elected, is addressing Canada’s trade spat with the US before calling for general elections. Like the other candidates, Gould has advocated a tough line on Trump.
Frank Baylis:The businessman from Montreal has served as a lawmaker from 2015 to 2019. In February, he unveiled a proposal to create two pipelines that would transport natural gas to international markets in Europe and Asia to reduce dependence on the United States.
The businessman has cautioned against Canada’s economy being “so reliant on one country” and stressed the need to diversify trading partners.
Baylis has criticized Trudeau for his dealings with US President Donald Trump and said the prime minister and premiers made “mistakes” with the US president, including traveling to Mar-a-Lago in November to meet Trump.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/16/americas/trump-hiv-latin-america-intl-latam/index.html,"It was nearly 30 years ago when Rosember Lopez received a life-altering diagnosis: He was HIV positive.
With scant government resources for HIV support at the time in Mexico, Lopez joined advocacy groups to secure the funding he needed for medication to help him survive.
“In the first years after my diagnosis, it was very difficult for me,” he told CNN. “We had to fight for access to medications,” he added of himself and others with the disease.
The experience inspired him to start his own organization in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, to help destigmatize HIV with the help of funding from the United States.
Today, his is one of dozens of aid groups across Latin America in jeopardy due to the Trump administration’sfreezeon almost all international aid and the gutting of the US’ global development network.
The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief(PEPFAR), a George W. Bush-era program that has enjoyed bipartisan support, was among those hit by US President Donald Trump’s actions. Relief groups have warned that halting programs such as PEPFAR could pose a risk to the lives of millions of people who will have to stop their HIV treatment, potentially opening the door to a HIV resurgence.
Organizations like Lopez’s help those with the disease access antiretroviral medications needed to reduce the risk of transmission, and give them a chance at a long, healthy life.
After hearing about the aid freeze in late January, Lopez began to worry not only about the future of his organization, A Helping Hand in the Fight Against AIDS (UMALCS), but also the deaths that could result from the lack of HIV care.
“It took me back to the times when there was no support and I said, ‘Well, now what is going to happen if we are no longer going to have the support of antiretroviral treatments?’” he said.
PEPFAR has been a lifeline for those living with HIV and AIDS, saving tens ofmillions ofpeople across the world since its inception, say advocates.
But Trump’sfreeze on foreign aidincluded a stop work order for all aid groups to immediately halt US-funded programs. Despite the State Department later issuing a waiver for “life-saving” assistance, some aid groups say funding is stillhalted. Contacting USAID officers who grant approval for work to continue has also been increasingly difficult as changes stifle the agency, a source from one US contractor told CNN.

CNN spoke to aid organizations and healthcare workers across Latin America who say that following the stop work order, they were unable to distribute vital medicine already on the shelves in pharmacies, including the HIV prevention medication PrEP.
An interruption in treatments could allow HIV to rebound in less than a month, in some cases, and could lead to more resistant strains arising, Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, told CNN. “We’re shooting ourselves in the face,” he said.
Without consistent treatment, Spencer warned that in a span of weeks or months, “We’re going to have people who had their HIV well controlled, who will be uncontrolled. You will have people that could not have transmitted who will be able to transmit now.”
If PEPFAR is not reauthorized for the next four years, and without other resources for the HIV response, there would be 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths in the near future, a 400% increase, Christine Stegling, the deputy executive director of the United Nations agency tasked with tackling HIV and AIDS, UNAIDS.
“It’s like crash landing an airplane,” Asia Russell, Executive Director of Health GAP, a global HIV treatment advocacy organization, told CNN of the stop work order. “Chaos has already been extreme in the field and recovery from that disruption is not easy.”
The lack of US funding is already impacting organizations in Colombia.
Some organizations, like Red Somos, which provides HIV care to Venezuelan migrants, have been forced to drastically scale back their operations.
David Marquez, the group’s social protection coordinator, told CNN that around 300 Venezuelan migrants with HIV cannot continue their treatment as it was run with PEPFAR support.
Related articleThey fled repression in Venezuela. They may migrate again due to the US foreign aid freeze
“This could be dangerous for their life,” Marquez said, adding that the organization is looking to other sources of funding.
Without explicit permission from the US to resume work, Red Somos has more than 170 antiretroviral drugs that are nearing their expiration date. The group also had to suspend its educational, social protection and mental health services since January.
Miguel Lopez, who was diagnosed with HIV 10 years ago, founded Más Que Tres Letras — which translates to “More Than Three Letters” — to normalize public discourse in Colombia about HIV and where to seek help.
While Lopez’s group relies on other donors, he still anticipates fallout from the latest US policy. Lopez and his team worry there might not be enough money to go around as organizations that once relied on US funding are now scrambling to find other donors.
“There is not going to be enough money for everyone,” Lopez said.
In Haiti, Dr. Alain Casseus and his colleagues at healthcare organization Zanmi Lasante have been severely impacted by the aid freeze.
Thousands of Haitians rely on them for HIV care, but “we basically have to reduce our activities,” he told CNN.
A USAID worker in Haiti — who was not put on leave — told CNN the State Department’s waiver does not cover some important aspects of HIV care, like psychological and economic support for impacted families.
Some approved services can’t immediately resume for aid groups that have already cut down on staff and are operating at reduced capacity.
There are parts of Haiti that rely almost solely on American funding for their healthcare needs, the USAID employee said. “If these health facilities were not there, people would receive no medications, no healthcare, nothing.”
Without funding, aid groups in Latin America are calling on the international community for help. “We are already feeling the impact, as some US organizations that funded our work in Mexico are now shutting down,” Lopez from Mexico told CNN.
“We urgently need international support to sustain our work.”",americas
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/26/americas/mexico-supreme-court-gun-lawsuit-latam-intl/index.html,"The legal team representing Mexico in a lawsuit against eight firearms manufacturers in the United States is preparing to argue part of their case before the US Supreme Court on March 4, according to Pablo Arrocha, legal consultant for the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“This case is going through a stage where questions of admissibility will still be reviewed, not of substance,” Arrocha clarified on Tuesday at the International Forum on Arms Trafficking and Diversion in Latin America organized by the Center for Economic Research and Teaching (CIDE).
The Mexican government sued several US arms manufacturers in 2021, accusing them of providing weapons that ultimately reach drug cartels operating in the country and demanding compensation for economic and social damages resulting from armed violence.
Mexico, which has onlyone gun store, has claimed in the past that between 70% and90% of all gunsrecovered from Mexican crime scenes come from the US. A2024 reportfrom the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that 72% of international gun trafficking cases originating in the US featured Mexico as the target country.

In October 2024, the US Supreme Court granted a request by Smith & Wesson and other companies to review a federal appeals court ruling that revived the case after a lower court judge dismissed it, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This is a law that generally bars civil liability for firearms manufacturers and distributors for the use of their products by criminal third parties.
In court filings, the manufacturers have challenged Mexico’s allegations that they were aiding and abetting the illegal sale of their weapons in violation of US federal law. They have pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling that shielded Twitter from a lawsuit alleging it aided and abetted terrorism by hosting tweets from the terrorist group ISIS.
“In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,” the manufacturerswrotein a November 2024 brief.
A second lawsuit, filed by Mexico in October 2022 in an Arizona court against five stores that sell guns, is in the evidence-gathering stage, according to Arrocha. Mexico accuses them of negligence, public nuisance and unjust enrichment.
According to the ATF, the Arizona to Mexico gun trafficking pipeline is second only to the illicit firearms trade between Texas and Mexico.
The legal advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that both lawsuits are moving forward and that there are scenarios for any type of outcome.
“This is the beginning, and this is the tip of the spear of something that can allow for much broader litigation strategies in the future,” he said at the forum.
The case comes to the Supreme Court at a moment of diplomatic tension between Mexico and the US. Last week, the US officially designatedsix Mexican drug cartelsas terrorist groups, an act that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum characterized aspotentially endangering Mexican sovereignty.
At the same press conference, Sheinbaum declared that she would seek reforms to prosecute “any national or foreigner involved in the illicit manufacture, distribution, disposal, transfer and internment of weapons into [Mexico’s] national territory.”",americas

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/27/americas/mexico-supreme-court-elephant-ruling-scli-intl/index.html,"Mexico’s Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a zoo to improve the health of an African elephant named Ely, the first time the country’s highest court has made such a move in favor of an animal.
The court ordered that there be “a constant improvement of her health and physical condition.”
The decision by a panel of four justices upheld a lower court’s order last year in Ely’s favor and experts believe it could set a precedent in Mexico recognizing that animals have rights.
Advocates have argued that Ely suffered from depression, especially since the death of Maggie, the other elephant sharing her habitat, in 2016, as well as illnesses she suffered in captivity.
Ely would bang against the walls of her enclosure and lost weight. Her defenders called her “the world’s saddest elephant.”
That was when Diana Valencia, founder and director of the animal rights group Opening Cages and Opening Minds, met Ely.
“It really moved me to see the state that she was in, it tore my soul and I made Ely a promise,” Valencia said, who has continued to visit the elephant regularly over the years.
She told Ely, “‘They aren’t going to do the same to you.’”
Ely, who is estimated to be between 43 and 45 years old, has lived at the San Juan de Aragon zoo in Mexico City for 13 years since being rescued from a circus.
Wednesday’s ruling follows another high court decision last month when it determined that Mexico City laws against animal mistreatment and cruelty were constitutional.
Valencia conceded that the zoo had improved Ely’s living conditions, but only after public pressure.
The zoo expanded the elephant enclosure and added two more elephants in 2023 and 2024.
Veterinarian Gabriela Uribe Acosta, director of the zoo, said she was confident the zoo could fully comply with the court’s order to improve Ely’s life.
She said a team of six people are responsible for keeping her enclosure of more than 78,000 square feet clean and another half dozen people are monitoring her health.
Uribe Acosta dismissed assertions that Ely is depressed. She said the elephant was stable and had improved since the other elephants were added. She moves around more and has new vocalizations.

She said that when Ely arrived in 2012, after years in a circus, she had a problem with her rear right leg that limited her mobility, as well as nutritional deficiencies resulting from a poor diet.
But Wednesday’s order could reverberate beyond Ely.
Lawyer Sergio Méndez Silva, litigation coordinator for the local Foundation for Justice, said “Mexico is taking a significant step with a precedent like this and I believe this will mark a before and after.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/americas/ecuador-gangs-cocaine-noboa-trump/index.html,"The convoy moves fast — half a dozen unmarked pickups and SUVs, plates ripped off, weaving and speeding through traffic. The vehicles cross into bus lanes and straddle road dividers, but the other drivers barely react as they pass, numb — it seems — to this kind of chaos.
The convoy’s passengers suit up, adding tactical vests over their clothes, ski masks over their heads. If not for POLICIA emblazoned across their body armor, anyone would think this was a crew of masked bandits, not the undercover law enforcement officers they are.
The vehicles screech into a neighborhood in Pascuales, a gang stronghold in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s biggest city, allowing CNN to follow them.
Families are grilling outside, and children splash in pools set up in the tightly packed streets as the largely Catholic population celebrates the end of Carnival and prepares for the start of Lent.
Officers pile out of the vehicles and rush into multiple homes at once. Police tell us they have four targets — suspects linked to the drug trade that’s making this city so dangerous.
When the raid ends, only one man is taken into custody. Relatives quickly step forward, removing the man’s bracelets and earrings as officers load him into the back of a pickup truck. His mother, arriving just in time to see him taken, shouts through tears: “Que Dios te bendiga” (may God bless you).
Police officials tell us the operation was a success and that along with the suspect they seized approximately 150 grams (5.3 ounces) of cocaine and two small explosives.
But one of the undercover officers has something else to say. “We could use the US’s help,” he tells us, not wanting to give his name in case it jeopardizes his security. “We need resources: vehicles, armor, personnel.”
The problem is certainly a lot bigger than a bag of cocaine weighing about the same as a peach or a baseball.
Sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, top producers of cocaine, Ecuador has become caught up in the drug trade and the violence that always follows it. Its efficient transport and export system has been used by cartels to move and ship their goods overseas — the bricks of cocaine hidden in boxes of bananas and other goods that then head to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world.
Police dogs alerted officers to more than six tons of cocaine concealed under bananas in a port outside Guayaquil last July,officials reported. And in November,Spanish police saidthey had made their biggest drugs bust ever — finding 13 tons of cocaine under bananas shipped from Guayaquil.
As well as checks in the ports and the targeted raids, police make a show of force — stopping cars and searching for drugs and weapons.
Under stormy gray skies, they ask drivers to step out into the thick humidity while they search inside vehicles, in the trunks and even in the depths of the engine, making sure there’s no illicit package taped out of sight, trying to evade detection.
“We’ve pinpointed the most dangerous areas in the city to carry out these anti-crime operations,” says police Capt. Orlando Posligua, standing by a bus terminal in Guayaquil.
But there’s limited success. The neighborhood that had the lightning raid, its city and perhaps even the whole country is becoming inured to crime, the residents tell us.
The officers from the raid point to a house where, they say, two months earlier, a couple was gunned down. There’s a bullet hole in the front door, near a faded sticker reading “Somos Católicos” and images of the Virgin Mary. From the outside, we can still see a pool of dried blood left uncleaned on the floor. Asked why the couple were targeted, we are told they hadn’t paid their “vacuna” — a protection fee the gangs demand from families and businesses.
The mix of gangs, drugs and public safety are driving rising migration from Ecuador and all of that offers opportunities for President Daniel Noboa to ask for help from the US and President Donald Trump.
Noboa — who’s in atight race for re-election next month— wants foreign military assistance and many here believe that means US troops.
The countries have a degree of military cooperation already. The US State Department has spent $81 million helping Ecuador tackle drugs and cartels since 2018, and there is a Status of Forces Agreement in effect, allowing US military and civilian personnel to be sent to Ecuador but remain under US control if needed.
Noboa’s proposal needs to go through the Ecuadorian congress, but it already has some support in Guayaquil, the most populous city in the country, and now also one of the most dangerous.
“I think (foreign assistance) is necessary, local police don’t really help us,” resident Kathy Flor tells CNN. “We need more control.”
Jaqueline Villacres, who sells candy, snacks and cigarettes from a tiny kiosk near the bus station, agrees: “It would be excellent to get foreign support to help the Ecuadorians.”
The undercover officer pointed out that the US used to station troops at a base in Manta, in the west of Ecuador on the Pacific coast, before foreign bases were outlawed by the constitution. “I want to have US troops back at the base they once occupied,” he says.
But Stalin Escobar says he is suspicious of the costs that Ecuador could end up paying. “I don’t think it would come here for free … the government needs to invest that money to equip our police and military instead of paying foreigners.”
Looking to Trump for help could be a natural thing for Noboa to do.
He already has ties with the US president, accepting an invitation for him and his wife Lavinia Valbonesi to be in the Capitol Rotunda for Trump’s second inauguration.
The 37-year-old has also mirrored some of Trump’s actions and words.
The day of Trump’s inauguration, theEcuadorian president’s X account postedhow he supported the US intention to categorizedrug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, something he had already done.
And Noboa — also the son of a wealthy magnate, though in his case it’s bananas not property — raised tariffs on imports from Mexico on February 3, just as Trump was doing the same before last-minute negotiations delayed the change for a month.
Noboa would not want to hurt business with the US, which is Ecuador’s largest trade partner as well as a leading investor. About one in five of the bananas imported to the US comes from Ecuador, which also supplies shrimp, tuna, cacao and cut flowers.
He could also play into Trump’s plans to stem illegal immigration into the US.Data showsEcuador is accepting more deportation flights since Trump became president, but there are also more Ecuadorians heading north since the security at home got worse.
While the numbers of people from Mexico and the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras encountered by Customs and Border Protection all fell in 2023 and 2024, there was a jump from Ecuador.
In 2022, CBP found 24,936 Ecuadorians traveling without documents, but in 2024 that figure shot up to 124,023, government statistics show.
Still, Noboa’s courting of Trump may lead to little. He faces therun-off presidential electionin April when the electorate will choose between him and his leftist rival, Luisa González. She also promises to tackle the security problems with crime and drugs, but says while Noboa represents fear, she stands for hope.",americas

“Deise was alone in the cell. The circumstances will be investigated by the Civil Police and the General Institute of Expertise,” the statement added.
CNN Brasil reported that Dos Anjos’ husband, Diego, asked for a divorce the day before her death.
The cake poisoning, which killed three people and hospitalized three others, occurred on Christmas Eve in the city of Torres in Rio Grande do Sul.
Large amounts of arsenic were found in the bodies of the women who died, and arsenic at levels 2,700 times higher than the permitted limit was found in the flour used to make the cake, according to the police.
Dos Anjos, who was arrested in early January and charged with triple homicide as well as three attempted homicides, was the daughter-in-law of one of the victims, 60-year-old Zeli dos Anjos, police confirmed at the time. Zeli made the cake, according to CNN Brasil.

“We need you to act decisively and without fear of reprisal,” Noboa wrote in a post on X on Friday morning. “Defend the country, I will defend you.”
It’s not the first time the increasingly hardline Noboa has offered pardons to security officers fighting crime in Ecuador, even before they have been deployed or accused of wrongdoing.
CNN en Español has reached out to the president’s office for clarification on the extent of the pardons.
The attack in Guayaquil unfolded across three locations in the city on Thursday afternoon and left at least 22 people dead and six injured, authorities told CNNE.

“Preliminary reports” suggest that the attack arose out of a profit-sharing dispute between different factions of the Los Tiguerones criminal gang, according to a police statement shared with CNNE.
“Among the deceased and injured, several have a history of robbery, drug trafficking, and weapons possession,” police wrote.
Ecuadorean authorities raided “several homes” overnight and early in the morning after the attack, arresting 14 individuals and seizing weapons and ammunition, Ecuador’s Ministry of Defense announcedin a poston X on Friday.
Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, has suffered grievously in the country’s ongoing drug-fueled violence epidemic. In 2024, the city recorded nearly 2,000 homicides, government statistics show.
Noboa has sought to crack down on Ecuador’s spiraling security crisis since becoming president in 2023, declaring several states of emergency and designating 22 criminal organizations as terrorist groups, moves that have prompted criticism from some rights groups domestically and abroad.
Instability in Ecuador, fueled by the international drug trade, has been the backdrop of Noboa’s campaign for a second term this year. He fell short of securing an outright majority in the first round of voting in Ecuador’s general election last month.

The National Council for Energy Policy’s approval came in response to an official invitation in 2023. The group includes the 12 members of OPEC, the longstanding group set up to coordinate oil production to stabilize markets, plus 10 more significant oil-producing nations with Russia by far the largest.

Though non-OPEC members agree to cooperate with OPEC nations, Brazil won’t have any binding obligation such as production cuts, Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said at a news conference.
Silveira called OPEC+ merely “a forum for discussing strategies among oil-producing countries. We should not be ashamed of being oil producers. Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.”
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began his third term in 2023 touting himself as an environmental defender, and has worked to reduce deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and to protect Indigenous rights. But he has also argued that new oil revenues could finance a transition to green energy.
In recent weeks, he has pressed the country’s environmental regulator to approve exploratory drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River, one of the most biodiverse regions of the world.
Brazil is the world’s seventh-largest oil producer, with about 4.3 million barrels daily, or 4% of the world´s output, according to Energy Information Administration, a US government agency. In 2024, crude oil became the country´s top export product, accounting for 13.3% of Brazil’s foreign sales, surpassing soy.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/asia/north-korea-nuclear-submarine-int-latam/index.html,"North Korea unveiled for the first time a nuclear-powered submarine under construction, a weapons system that can pose a major security threat to South Korea and the US.
State media on Saturday released photos showing what it called “a nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine,” as it reported leader Kim Jong Un’s visits to major shipyards where warships are built.
The Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, didn’t provide details on the submarine, but said Kim was briefed on its construction.
The naval vessel appears to be a 6,000-ton-class or 7,000-ton-class one which can carry about 10 missiles, said Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert who teaches at Seoul’s Hanyang University. He said the use of the term “the strategic guided missiles” meant it would carry nuclear-capable weapons.
“It would be absolutely threatening to us and the US,” Moon said.
A nuclear-powered submarine was among a long wishlist of sophisticated weaponry that Kim vowed to introduce during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called escalating US-led military threats. Other weapons weresolid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles,hypersonic weapons, spy satellites andmulti-warhead missiles.North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.
North Korea obtaining a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development because it’s difficult for its rivals to detect such launches in advance.
Questions about how North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines have surfaced.
Moon, the submarine expert, said North Korea may have received Russian technological assistance to build a nuclear reactor to be used in the submarine in return for supplying conventional weapons and troops to support Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine.
He also said North Korea could launch the submarine in one or two years to test its capability before its actual deployment.
North Korea has an estimated 70-90 diesel-powered submarines in one of the world’s largest fleets. However, they are mostly aging ones capable of launching only torpedoes and mines, not missiles.

In 2023, North Korea said it had launched what it called its first “tactical nuclear attack submarine,” but foreign experts doubted the North’s announcement and speculated it was likely a diesel-powered submarine disclosed in 2019. Moon said there has been no confirmation that it has been deployed.
North Korea has conducted a slew of underwater-launched ballistic missile tests since 2016, but all launches were made from the same 2,000-ton-class submarine which has a single launch tube.
Many experts call it a test platform, rather than an operational submarine in active service.
In recent days, North Korea has been dialing up its fiery rhetoric against the US and South Korea ahead of their upcoming annual military drills set to start Monday.
During his visits to the shipyards, Kim said North Korea aims to modernize water-surface and underwater warships simultaneously.
He stressed the need to make “the incomparably overwhelming warships fulfill their mission” to contain “the inveterate gunboat diplomacy of the hostile forces,” KCNA reported Saturday.",asia

Sunday’s fighting is the biggest so far this year and the second major clash in less than a month in Chhattisgarh, according to police officer Jitendra Yadav.
At least 16 rebels were killed in the state’s Gariband district on Jan. 23. According to Indian officials, the government had issued a bounty for 12 of them totaling about $345,000. Eight rebels were killed in a gunbattle with troops in the Bijapur district on Jan. 31.
Indian soldiers have been battling the Maoist rebels across several central and northern states since 1967, when the militants, also known as Naxalites, began fighting to demand more jobs, land and wealth from natural resources for the country’s poor indigenous communities. The insurgents are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
Years of neglect have isolated many locals, who face a lack of jobs, schools and health care clinics, making them open to overtures by the rebels.

Yoon remains suspended from his duties and still faces ongoing criminal and impeachment trials.
He was seen bowing to cheering supporters, who were waving Korean and US flags, as he walked out of the detention center in Uiwang on Saturday.
“I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the many citizens who have supported me despite the cold weather, as well as to our future generations,” Yoon said in a statement following his release.
His release came after Seoul Central District Court on Fridaycanceled his arrest warrantbased on technical and legal grounds. The Seoul Detention Center confirmed to CNN earlier on Saturday that they received a letter from the Seoul prosecutors’ office ordering his release.
Yoon has been in detention since January when he was arrested on charges of leading an insurrection – one of the few criminal charges the president does not have immunity from.
His December 3 decree threw South Korea into turmoil when he banned political activity and sent troops to the heart of the nation’s democracy – only to reverse the move within six hours after lawmakers forced their way into parliament and voted unanimously to block it.
Lawmakers have since voted to impeach him and he is now waiting for the country’s Constitutional Court to decide whether he will be removed from office permanently or be reinstated.
His impeachment trial is separate from the criminal charges he faces.
His release means that Yoon can now await the impeachment verdict, expected to come in coming weeks, from home instead of in detention.
South Korea’s main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung, said Friday that the court ruling does not clear Yoon of allegations he “destroyed the constitutional order through an unconstitutional military coup.”

In 2023, the birthrate fell for the eighth consecutive year to 0.72, the lowest in the world, from 1.24 in 2015, raising concerns over the economic shock to society from such a rapid pace.
Since 2018, South Korea has been the only member of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) with a rate below 1.
South Korea has rolled out various measures to encourage young people to get married and have children, after now suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol declared a “national demographic crisis” and a plan to create a new ministry devoted to tackling low birth rates.
“There was a change in social value, with more positive views about marriage and childbirth,” Park Hyun-jung, an official at Statistics Korea, told a briefing, also citing the impact of a rise in the number of people in their early 30s and pandemic delays.
“It is difficult to measure how much each factor contributed to the rise in new births, but they themselves had an impact on each other too,” Park said.
Marriages, a leading indicator of new births, jumped 14.9% in 2024, the biggest spike since the data started being released in 1970. Marriages turned up for the first time in 11 years in 2023 with a 1.0% increase powered by a post-pandemic boost.
In the Asian country, there is a high correlation between marriages and births, with a time lag of one or two years, as marriage is often seen as a prerequisite to having children.

The two teams strutted out into the National Stadium in Karachi to a huge roar from the crowd, getting underway the Champions Trophy tournament that cricket-obsessed Pakistan hopes will cement its rehabilitation into the cricketing world.
Long roiled byIslamist militancyand terror attacks – including a deadly attack on a visiting Sri Lanka cricket team in 2009 – Pakistan has for years been off the roster for international tournaments.
Now world cricket powerhouses like Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand and South Africa are here for around three weeks of cricket, and fans are ecstatic.
Authorities in Karachi were taking no chances during the opening match between Pakistan and New Zealand on Wednesday.
Snipers were in position on rooftops along routes to the stadium. Commandos and SWAT teams manned checkpoints around the sprawling port city.
Farah Qadri spent hours under the blazing sun passing through security checkpoints outside the stadium, but said the “surreal” experience of seeing the opening game of the tournament was worth the wait.
There were people from “all walks of life huddled together, cheering, chanting and dancing nonstop,” she told CNN.
The Champions Trophy “is a huge positive for the entire country,” said Basit Ali, 36, who watched the opening match from a teashop in Peshawar near the Afghan border.
“I pray that Pakistan successfully defends its title and brings joy to the nation.”
Cricket is almost a second religion in Pakistan, with superstars plastered on billboards, and the national team the objects of intense pride – or anger – depending on results.
But the last time Pakistan hosted an international tournament was in 1996.
That’s meant an entire generation in the nation of around 220 million has come of age without experiencing the thrill of playing host to the world’s best.
Excitement mingled with nervousness for Farees Shah, a cricket podcast host who also joined the throng of fans in the Karachi stadium on Wednesday.
It’s like “you’re the biggest party animal out there but after ages you’re hosting the party, so you just want to make sure everything goes smoothly,” he told CNN.
Events off the cricket pitch rarely go smoothly in Pakistan.
Former prime minister – and World Cup-winning cricketer – Imran Khan is currently in jail for corruption and revealing official secrets – charges he says are a plot by rivals to keep him from returning to office.
The country’seconomy is totteringand reliant on IMF bailouts, while the powerful military is entrenched in every aspect of life, according to its critics.
A long-running Taliban insurgency has killed tens of thousands, while authorities are also battling a festering and bloody separatist movement in the resource-rich southwest.
Cricket has been caught up in the violence too.
In 2009 Sri Lanka’s cricket team was attacked by militants on their way to a match in the northeastern city of Lahore.
The gunmen sprayed the team bus with bullets as it neared the stadium, killing eight people – six policemen and two civilians – and leaving several of the visiting players wounded, sending shock waves across the cricket world.
Pakistan was subsequently stripped of hosting rights for the 2009 Champions Trophy.
A later militant attack caused the country to be ruled out of co-hosting the 2011 World Cup.
Hosting the Champions Trophy is a “milestone moment” for Pakistan, the chairman of Pakistan’s Cricket Board (PCB) Mohsin Naqvi told CNN in a statement.
The tournament is an “opportunity to reaffirm Pakistan’s status as one of the most passionate and influential cricketing nations, fully capable of staging multi-nation tournaments at the highest level,” he said.
Authorities say they are pulling out all stops.
The national airline is putting on special flights to ferry the visiting teams around the country to their matches.
Every player and match official has been given “state guest status” according to authorities – the equivalent of being treated like a visiting head of state.
There is one hiccup, however.
India, the top-ranked cricket team in the world – and Pakistan’s fiercest rival – isn’t coming to the party.
Cricketing officials there have cited “security reasons” for refusing to come to Pakistan.
India will play its matches instead in the United Arab Emirates.
That decision has dampened the mood of fans globally and enraged Pakistani ones, denying the hosts the chance to face off against their neighbor and biggest rival on home turf.

Eight MK-82 general-purpose bombs were “abnormally dropped” from two KF-16 fighter jets and landed outside the designated firing range at approximately 10:07 a.m. local time, hitting civilian infrastructure in Pocheon city, northeast of the capital Seoul, according to the South Korean Air Force.
South Korea’s defense ministry said initial findings indicated the accident was caused by a pilot inputting incorrect bombing coordinates.
An image that local media outlets said captured the aftermath of the explosions showed thick smoke billowing into the air in a rural area.
At least 29 people, including 14 soldiers, were injured in the incident, according to authorities. Among 15 injured civilians, two people were seriously wounded.
The blasts destroyed two residential buildings, part of a church, and a truck.
“The scene of the incident is chaotic, resembling a battlefield,” Pocheon Mayor Baek Young-hyun said in a televised statement.
The aircraft were participating in a joint live-fire exercise with the South Korean Army and the US military, related to the annual joint US-South Korea“Freedom Shield” military drills, the South Korean Air Force told CNN, without providing further details.
South Korea’s military said all live-fire training would be suspended from Thursday until a probe into the incident had concluded. An accident response team has been formed to investigate and the air force said it would provide compensation for damages.
The air force apologized that the “abnormal bomb release has caused civilian damage” and wished the injured a swift recovery.
Officials have not ruled out the possibility of a malfunction, an air force official told CNN.
A spokesperson for the United States Forces Korea (USFK) later said in a statement that no US Air Force aircraft were involved in the exercise. Besides the suspended live-fire training, the other planned military exercises would go ahead, and the USFK is coordinating with Korean authorities on the investigation, it said.
The Freedom Shield drills were scheduled to run from March 10 to March 20 to strengthen the US-South Korean alliance’s combined defense posture, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier Thursday.
The annual drills often rile nuclear-armedNorth Korea, which views them as provocations. In a statement in state-run media on Friday, North Korean authorities condemned the exercises for “infringing on its sovereignty and security interests,” and warned that the US and South Korea would “pay a severe price.”
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has accused the United States and South Korea of increasing tensions with their joint drills and Pyongyang often responds with bellicose threats.
In 2023, as US strategic bombers took part in joint air drills with South Korean forces, North Korea carried out a ballistic missile test, according to the South Korean military.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/26/asia/ukraine-war-north-korean-troops-russian-ships-hnk-intl/index.html,"Hundreds of North Korean troops were likely transported by sea to Russia to fight in its war against Ukraine, satellite images have revealed, according to a new analysis from a US-based think tank shared exclusively with CNN.
At least two Russian naval ships are believed to have movedNorth Koreansoldiers to a Russian military port in Dunai, in the far east, in October and November, according to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in California.
The ship transfers were first identified by the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), which said in a press release last year that some soldiers were transported via the North Korean port areas of Chongjin, Hamhung and Musudan. But the South Korean agency only offered a grainy radar image at the time.

“I don’t think that the Russians or the North Koreans want these transfers caught on camera,” Sam Lair, a research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told CNN. “The secrecy element is quite remarkable.”
Now, researchers have verified that during the same time period of the troop transfers reported by South Korea intelligence, the Russian vessels identified by the spy agency docked at Dunai port in a remote, eastern part of Russia.
In North Korea, soldiers likely boarded these ships at night, making it difficult to capture evidence of the transfers, researchers said. But satellite images have revealed activities at Dunai, “where it appears the Russians have been less careful.”
For example, in one satellite image from Planet Labs, a crane can be seen extending to one of Russia’s naval landing ships, which researchers believe is the Nikolay Vilkov, at the port on October 17, and a covered cargo truck is on the dock next to it. By October 20, the crane is retracted, and it appears a transfer of soldiers is complete.
Researchers could identify the Russian “Ropucha-class” and “Alligator-class” ships in the satellite images because they match with photos captured by the Japanese Defense Ministry in March 2022, when the vessels passed through Japanese waters.
Each landing ship is believed to have capacity to hold several hundred soldiers, possibly as many as 400, according to the researchers.
Lair explained that Dunai is a secure military facility, making it much more conducive to under-the-radar transfers than the large, nearby port of Vladivostok, which is in an area where civilians live.
“This is an isolated place where they can do these exchanges, where people aren’t going to notice… (where) their own citizens, and folks in the intelligence community might not notice,” Lair said.
An estimated 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports in January, which say around 4,000 of those troops have beenkilled or injured. Kyiv says it hascaptured at least twoNorth Korean soldiers. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have confirmed the existence of North Korean troops on the front lines.
CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.
North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk since late October to repel Ukraine’s incursion in the southern Russian border region.
“The Russians seem to have been very careful to limit the exposure of the North Korean soldiers, moving them directly to military training facilities. The motive behind all the secrecy surrounding the North Koreans is uncertain, but moving some of them through Dunai would aid in that effort,” Lair wrote in his analysis.
Dunai port has previously been used to transport cargo between Russia and the North Korea sincePyongyang started aiding the invasion of Ukrainein 2023, according to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.
Satellite images taken in October show a cargo ship being loaded at Rajin port in North Korea, and the same ship docked two days later at Dunai in Russia.
AnOctober 2023 reportfrom the UK-based think tank The Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) said that “Russia has likely begun shipping North Korean munitions at scale” to the “inconspicuous naval facility” tucked away in Dunai.
“We spend a lot of time looking at North Korea in general, because of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, their conventional weapons program, their missile programs… So, we’ve been monitoring the North Korea-Russia connection since it started, in part because we think that that relationship might be going both ways,” Lair said.
Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center think tank in Kyiv, told a forum in South Korea this week that North Korea is gaining valuable combat experience with its involvement in Ukraine.
“It’s not only about supplies of missiles, it’s about testing their missiles in real battlefield conditions,” Getmanchuk said during the forum at the Goethe Institute in Seoul.
She said North Korea has used that experience to upgrade missiles to make them more accurate.
Pyongyang’s ground troops are also getting better, Getmanchuk said.
“They came totally unprepared… Now they are learning very quickly,” adapting to their tactics to be effective in “modern, hi-tech warfare,” she added.
Lair said the Pyongyang-Moscow relationship hasdeepened since the invasion began. “Sending your own soldiers to fight in someone else’s conflict really suggests the strength of the connection,” he said.
There are indications that Russia and North Korea are no longer using the sea route to transport troops, according to the think tank. Meanwhile, South Korean intelligence has reported that Russian military planes are frequently flying between Vladivostok and Pyongyang.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/20/asia/south-korea-yoon-insurrection-trial-intl/index.html,"South Korea’s impeached PresidentYoon Suk Yeolappeared in a Seoul court on Thursday for his first trial hearing on charges of insurrection in the country’s first criminal prosecution of an incumbent leader.
Last month prosecutors indicted Yoon after accusing him of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3.
A justice ministry motorcade took Yoon from the Seoul Detention Center, where he is being held, to the court, outside which were parked lines of police buses to ensure security.
Prosecutors called for swift proceedings considering the gravity of the case, but Yoon’s lawyers said they needed more time to review records.
Yoon had “no intention to paralyse the country,” one of his lawyers told the court, adding that his martial law declaration aimed to tell the public of the “legislative dictatorship of the huge opposition party.”
If convicted, Yoon could face years in prison for his martial law decree, which shocked the country and sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media.
The move unleashed political upheaval in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a top US ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power, while top military officials were indicted for their part in the matter.
The court also heard a bid by Yoon’s lawyers to cancel his detention, saying the matter had been investigated in an illegal manner, and that there was no risk of Yoon trying to destroy evidence.
It was unclear when the court would rule on the detention, but a judge set the next hearing of the criminal case for March 24.
After the criminal case, Yoon also attended on Thursday afternoon a parallel impeachment trial by the Constitutional Court that has entered its final phase.
Witnesses testifying to the court included Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who has also been impeached and awaits the court’s decision on his fate.
“I am deeply burdened by the despair that each and every one of our people felt due to such extreme politics that took place before, during and after emergency martial law,” Han said.
“All procedures dealing with the emergency martial law must be carried out fairly and reasonably … so that there is no further spark of national division.”
The Constitutional Court is reviewing parliament’s impeachment of Yoon on December 14 and will decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him.
Yoon and his lawyers have argued that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock.
If Yoon is removed, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days.",asia

Tuesday’s incident waswitnessed by an Associated Press reporteraboard the single-engine Cessna Caravan plane operated by the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources as it patrolled near Scarborough Shoal, an uninhabited rock about 140 miles (222 kilometers) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon.
Scarborough Shoal, which sits amid rich fishing grounds, has been effectively controlled by China since 2012 despite its location inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
The AP report said during the approximately 30-minute encounter, the pilot of the Philippine plane warned the Chinese helicopter, “You are flying too close, you are very dangerous and endangering the lives of our crew and passengers.”

The ambassador of the United States, a defense treaty ally of Manila, condemned the “dangerous” maneuvers of the Chinese helicopter.
In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China “to refrain from coercive actions and settle its differences peacefully in accordance with international law.”
A statement from the PLA’s Southern Theater Command said the Chinese helicopter “expelled” the Philippine plane from “China’s territorial airspace,” while saying Manila “has seriously violated China’s sovereignty.”
Tuesday’s incident followed another last week over the South China Sea between an Australian military P-8 reconnaissance jet and PLA fighter planes, during which Australia said the Chinese jets fired flares within 100 feet (30 meters) of its aircraft.
If ingested into the P-8’s jet engines, the flares could have caused catastrophic damage, analysts said.
“They could have hit our P-8 and had that occurred it would have done significant damage to our aircraft and that obviously puts in danger the lives of our personnel,” Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said on Friday.

Like the latter incident with the Philippines, the Chinese military said it expelled a foreign aircraft that was intruding into Chinese airspace, in this case over the Xisha Islands, also called the Paracel Islands.
Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. As well as the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.
Potentially dangerous incidents between Chinese and foreign aircraft over the South China Sea are nothing new, with several reported over the past several years between not only Australian and Philippine craft but also those ofthe USandCanada, who all say they operate in international airspace.
But the two latest incidents in less than a week are raising fears Beijing may be becoming more assertive in enforcing its disputed claims while the attention of the US – a defense treaty ally of the Philippines, Australia and Canada – is focused on thewar in Ukraineand tensions in the Middle East.
“China sees that the Trump administration is focused on other theaters and calculates that this is the time to turn the ratchet up in East Asia while America is distracted elsewhere,” said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.

“Beijing is following a familiar pattern of gradual escalation,” Powell said.
“Its goal is to normalize its aggressions at ever-greater levels, so that over time they become accepted and discounted as the normal cost of doing business in contested areas.”
Adm.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/europe/chinese-student-guilty-raping-10-women-intl-latam/index.html,"A Chinese PhD student was found guilty Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in England and China, as police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
Zhenhao Zou, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court. He was convicted of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offenses relating to one victim.
After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in U.K. history.
Using hidden or handheld cameras to record the attacks, Zou filmed nine of the attacks as “souvenirs” and often kept a trophy box of women’s belongings.
Zou, a mechanical engineering student who was doing his PhD at University College London, claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual. He will be sentenced on June 19.
Jurors, who had to watch footage of the attacks during the trial, were given regular breaks.
Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offense, namely butanediol.
He was cleared of two further counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image and one of possession of MDMA with intent to commit a sexual offense.
Zou, who also used the name Pakho online, befriended fellow students of Chinese heritage on WeChat and dating apps, before inviting them for drinks and drugging them at his apartments in London or an unknown location in China.
“He has done all that he can in these offenses to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
He thanked the two women who testified against the “particularly cowardly and deceitful” Zou and said there is evidence that he “may have potentially attacked as many as 50 other women in the same awful nature.”
The Met is appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact the force.
During the trial, a call to police from one of the women led to questions over the quality of the interpreter made available.
“It’s a matter of severe regret that the victims didn’t necessarily get that best translation at the time,” Southworth added.
Zou moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2017 to study mechanical engineering at Queen’s University before heading to UCL in 2019 for a master’s degree and then a PhD.
“Our thoughts are with the survivors and we wish to pay tribute to the bravery of the women who reported these crimes and gave evidence at the trial,” said UCL’s president, Dr. Michael Spence.",asia

Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said the parents rejected the ransom demand but the kidnappers, who included former Filipino police officers and soldiers, abandoned the 14-year-old student Tuesday night in the middle of a busy street in metropolitan Manila when police closed in on their vehicle.

The Feb. 20 kidnapping of the student after attending classes at a British school in Manila set off alarms due to its brazenness and brutality.
Remulla told reporters that the student’s family and the Chinese leader of the kidnappers allegedly were former operators of lucrative online gambling outfits, which flourished under former President Rodrigo Duterte but were ordered shut last year by his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
The online gambling outfits, which operated in the Philippines, Cambodia and other Southeast Asian countries, have catered to large numbers of clients in China, where gambling is prohibited.
“We know that this crime involved a Chinese against a Chinese,” Remulla said, adding that the student’s family and the kidnappers communicated in Chinese via the WeChat app.
After the closure of illegal gambling outfits in the Philippines, some turned to other crimes, including kidnapping, Remulla said. Officials said online cryptocurrency sites, love and investment scams remained a threat.

In a bid to pressure the student’s family to pay a ransom of $20 million, which was later reduced to $1 million, the kidnappers cut off the tip of the small finger in the victim’s right hand and sent a video of the gruesome act to his parents, Remulla said.
The student’s driver was killed and later found in an abandoned vehicle, where crucial evidence, including cellphone numbers, were found.

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/japan-worlds-smallest-park-intl-hnk/index.html,"If you want to take a stroll around this park in Japan, you will have to be very nimble on your toes.
A park roughly the size of four sheets of paper in Japan’s central prefecture of Shizuoka was recently crowned the world’s smallest, according to Guinness World Records.
Despite measuring just 2.6 square feet, the recreational space offers a stool made up of a block of wood held up by a rock, with a little bush encircling it.
From afar, it could easily be mistaken for a bonsai, an example of the Japanese art of manicuring miniature trees.
The park is a short walk from the town hall of Nagaizumi, about 68 miles southwest of the capital Tokyo.
The previous official world’s smallest park was Mill Ends Park in Portland, Oregon, which helped inspire the Japanese contender that officially took the title on Tuesday, according to Guinness.
When a Nagaizumi local was on vacation in the US, “they found the previous record holder for the smallest park,” Shuji Koyama, a team leader of the town’s construction division, told Guinness. “So they wanted to create an even smaller park.”
Locals have been referring to it as the world’s smallest park since it was built in 1988, despite a lack of official recognition.
To qualify for the Guinness title, Shizuoka officials brought in a certified surveyor to measure the park.
Koyama told Guinness World Records he was relieved that the park was finally recognized.
“We want to continue maintaining the park with the community, as well as creating a landscape that is more social media friendly, so that even more people will find attractions of our town,” he said.

A group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in Bannu, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and said that dozens of members of Pakistani security forces were killed. The military didn’t immediately confirm any casualties, but Bannu District Hospital said that at least a dozen people were dead.
The two suicide bombers blew themselves up near the wall of the sprawling military area, a security official said on condition of anonymity, because he wasn’t authorized to speak with reporters.
“After a breach in the wall, five to six more attackers attempted to enter the cantonment, but were eliminated,” the security official said.
The attack happened after sunset, when people would have been breaking their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

In travel news this week: A German city cracks down on bad nudist etiquette, Western travelers visit North Korea, plus where to go for a US urban vacation.
If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right — and public nudity is no exception.
Beach wardens in Rostock, Germany, now have the power to issue bans to people wearing clothing on its naturist-only beaches.
The new regulation is because city offices “received numerous complaints from people who felt harassed in the naturist (or nudist) areas,” Rostock Tourism’s Moritz Naumann told CNN, and it’s intended only to be used in “case of conflict.”
There’s etiquette on nude beaches that should be followed.
Common infractions include staring, taking photos and unwanted comments, experts including Stéphane Deschênes, president of the International Naturist Federation (INF-FNI), told CNN last year in our guide tonude beach etiquette.
Rostock has 15 kilometers of beach (about nine miles), divided into naturist-only, mixed and textile-only — so all guests’ needs are covered, even if their bits and bobs aren’t.
Naturism has traditionally been hugely popular in Germany (read more in our story onFree Body Culture), but the movement is waning among younger generations.
Naumanntells CNN that city authorities have observed that “the number of people practicing it today is decreasing. Therefore, we have reduced the number of naturist beaches from 37 to 27 blocks with the new regulation.”
There are, however, still plenty of sandy spots where you can disrobe freely around the world. Here are 24 of the world’sbest nude beaches, from California to New Zealand.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/03/asia/japan-prince-hisahito-news-conference-intl-hnk/index.html,"Japan’sPrince Hisahito, the second in line to the throne, held a debut news conference on Monday, telling reporters he would try to balance official duties and his university studies and research about the dragonfly.
Hisahito turned 18 last September, becoming the first male royal family member to reach adulthood in almost four decades in Japan. It marked a significant development for a family that hasruled for more than a millenniumbut faces the same existential problems as the rest of the nation — a fast-aging, shrinking population.
The prince said he would follow the good examples of his uncle, Emperor Naruhito, and other elder members of the Imperial family, while pursuing his university studies, beginning next month.
Speaking to reporters at the Akasaka Estate residence in Tokyo, Hisahito said he believes the role of the emperor as a symbolic figure is someone who “always thinks of the people and stays close to them.”
Hisahito is second in line to Japan’s Chrysanthemum Throne, only after his father,Crown Prince Akishino. Before Hisahito’s birthday last year, his father had been the last male to reach adulthood in the family in 1985.
The prince is the youngest of the 16-member all-adult imperial family and one of only five men, including former Emperor Akihito. He said he barely had time to celebrate his adulthood on September 6 as he is still finishing high school.
The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative pre-war family values, only allows a male to succeed to the throne. Female royal members who marry commoners lose their royal status.
Hisahito’s older cousin, Princess Aiko — the only child of Naruhito and his wife Masako and a Harvard-educated former diplomat — is seen as the public’s favorite, though the law for now bars her from becoming an empress, despite being in a direct line of descent.
Japan’s conservative government wants to keep the royal succession male-only,without relying on women, though it is looking for a way to allow women to keep royal status if they marry commoners and serve in royal duties.
In his childhood, Hisahito showed an avid interest in insects and plans to study biology at the Tsukuba University near Tokyo, starting in April. He hopes to focus his studies on dragonflies, a species that has captivated him.
Apart from researching dragonflies and other insects, Hisahito told reporters he is also interested in studying ways to protect insect populations in urban areas. His other interests lie in growing tomatoes and rice on the palace compound.
Because Japanese royals have to stay away from politics, members of the Imperial Family tend to study biology, literature and arts. Naruhito’s specialty is water transport while his father, Emperor Emeritus Akihito whoabdicated in 2019, researches fish. Hisahito’s father, Crown Prince Akishino, is an expert of chickens.
Japan will hold a coming-of-age palace ceremony for Hisahito on September 6, his 19th birthday.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/22/india/kerala-india-teen-rape-allegations-dst-intl-hnk/index.html,"Editor’s Note: This article contains details that readers may find distressing.
Five years ago, a 13-year-old girl, the daughter of poor wage laborers from one of India’s most marginalized communities, was allegedly sexually abused by one of her neighbors in the village where she lived.
Her alleged abuser filmed it and police are investigating whether he used the images to blackmail and manipulate the girl into being raped and sexually abused by dozens of other men and boys over the next five years.
Police say the allegations only came to light after the girl, now 18, spoke to a counselor visiting her college in Kerala state and detailed the years of horrific abuse.
A total of 58 men and boys have been arrested and accused of the sexual assault, rape and gang rape of the girl. Another two men wanted in connection with the case have fled the country, Kerala Police Deputy Inspector General Ajeetha Begum told CNN.
Among the accused are her schoolmates, her relatives, her neighbors – men from all corners of her life, ranging from minors to men in their mid-40s, according to case documents reviewed by CNN and interviews with local police.
Charges have not yet been filed and the 58 men remain in detention. None of the accused has spoken publicly about the allegations. Under Indian rape laws, the girl has not been identified.
Violence against women is rampant in India due to entrenchedsexism and patriarchy, despite laws being amended to include more severepunishmentsfor abusers.
In August therape and murder of a trainee medic in the eastern city of Kolkatasparked a nationwide doctors’ strike that brought tens of thousands into the streets to demand change.
The Kerala case has not sparked similar outrage.
Experts and activists say that’s because the victim is from the Dalit community at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, a 3,000-year-old social and religious hierarchy that categorizes people at birth and defines their place in society.
Dalits traditionally carry out occupations viewed as ritually “unclean” by Hindu scripture, such as manual scavenging, waste picking and street sweeping.
They are often banned from visiting temples and forced to live apart from higher-caste communities, often in squalor and farther from access to services.
Despite legislation banning discrimination based on caste, activists say the stigma leaves India’s more than 260 million Dalits vulnerable to abuse and less able to seek redress for crimes committed against them.
“When it’s Dalit women, in general the outrage is less across the country,” said Cynthia Stephen, a Dalit rights activist and social policy researcher.
There is a sense that “this girl is not ‘one of us,’” she said.
The alleged abuse began when the young man from the village molested the girl and took sexually explicit videos and photos, police told CNN.
At least three of her abusers promised to marry her, according to police. One threatened to kill her if she reported the abuse.
Some of the men acted alone, police said. But others are accused of gang rape. “It’s not that all the cases are connected. But in one case, there might be four or five accused,” said Begum, from Kerala Police.
Many of the men contacted the young girl on her father’s phone, through social media apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, late at night after he went to sleep, police said.
The alleged abuse took place in private and public spaces, in homes and in cars, at bus stops and in fields. Some of the cases allegedly involved men who were strangers, living in towns dozens of miles away.
Some of the cases involve allegations of human trafficking, because the men forced the girl to travel outside her village, police said.
The allegations have sent shock waves through the girl’s village in the green hills of Kerala, where many work as wage laborers in low-paid jobs like construction and farming.
Police say the girl’s parents worked long hours and did not know about the alleged abuse of their daughter.
When the allegations emerged in January, some women in the community were sympathetic toward the accused and angry at the survivor, according tolocal media outlet The News Minute.
The women criticized the girl’s clothing and lifestyle and blamed her mother for not watching over her more closely, The News Minute reported.
One mother, whose son was among the accused, said he was innocent. She said he had known the girl since she was a baby and “had raised the girl in his arms,” according to the outlet.
More than half of Dalits in Kerala live in designated areas called “colonies,” known for cramped and harsh living conditions, after years of being denied land ownership under historical laws.
Many women and girls living in these colonies lack resources and privacy, making them more vulnerable to abuse, Rekha Raj, a Dalit feminist activist from Kerala, told CNN.
Madhumita Pandey, a professor in criminology and gender justice at Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom, said the tight-knit nature of communities such as these colonies could explain why the alleged abuse of the teenage girl was not reported until recently.
“They could sometimes be your friend, uncle or neighbor,” she said.
It can be harder to report abuse when “the so-called monsters are in our own backyard,”  she said.
Official statistics support her point: the alleged perpetrator is known to the victim in more than 98% of reported rape cases in Kerala, according to government data.
There were 4,241 reported cases of rape against women from oppressed castes in India, including Dalit women, in 2022, the most recent year for which data exists, according to India’s National Crime Records Bureau. That’s equivalent to more than 10 rapes per day.
There were more than 31,500 rapes reported overall in 2022, according to the NCRB.
However, given the difficulties in reporting such crimes, especially for the Dalit community, the true figure is likely higher.
Furthermore, in close communities, and especially in Dalit communities, women and girls also risk isolating themselves or being seen as bringing dishonor upon their families if they report abuse, Pandey said.
In at least 16 of the cases from the alleged Kerala village abuse, the accused men are from more privileged castes, according to police. If found guilty, these men could face harsher punishments under Indian laws designed to protect disadvantaged castes.
A 2020 report by the NGOEquality Nowfound that sexual violence is used by dominant castes to oppress Dalit women and girls, who are often denied justice because of a “prevalent culture of impunity, particularly when the perpetrators are from a dominant caste.”
Even when Dalit women report sexual abuse, they face an uphill battle to justice.
TheEquality Nowreport followed 40 cases of rape against Dalit women and girls, and the seven cases that resulted in convictions involved either rape and murder together or were committed against girls under the age of 6.

N Rajeev, the head of the Child Welfare Committee in Pathanamthitta, the Kerala district where the girl is from, said an increase in reported child sexual abuse cases was in part thanks to campaigns in schools that help children identify and disclose abuse. The number of reported child sexual abuse cases in the state has surged to 4,663 in 2023, more than four times the 1,002 reported in 2013, according to government data.
The Dalit girl is now living in a shelter where she is receiving counseling and support, Begum, the police officer, said. The girl’s mother is also being given counseling and has the option to stay in a women’s shelter if she feels unsafe in the neighborhood. Begum said police have dedicated “maximum manpower” to the case.
The case will likely take years to go through the courts.
Across India, rape has one of the lowest conviction rates of major crimes, with 27% of cases resulting in convictions in 2022, according to the NCRB.
While child sexual abuse continues to be a “a grim reality” in Kerala, the fact that the Dalit girl was able to report the case is a step in the right direction, Stephen said.
“Otherwise, this would have just gone on unreported for years on end, then she would have nobody to help her.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/10/india/india-hate-speech-report-hnk-intl/index.html,"India’sreligious minorities have faced a “staggering” rise in hate speech over the past year, including from top leaders of the ruling Hindu nationalist party of Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, according to a report released Monday.
The number of hate speech incidents targeting Muslim and Christian minorities rose to 1,165 in 2024 from 668 the year prior, a 74% increase, according to a report from the Washington-based research group, India Hate Lab. The majority of these, around 98%, targeted Muslims, either explicitly or alongside Christians.
“Hate speech in India in 2024 followed an alarming trajectory, deeply intertwined with the ideological ambitions of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the broader Hindu nationalist movement,” the report said.
Modi, whowon a third termin last year’s elections, has long been accused by critics of fueling religious tensions and inciting violence against Muslims and other minorities since assuming power more than a decade ago.
His Hindu nationalist party has sought to turn India – a nation constitutionally bound to secularism – into a Hindu rashtra, or homeland for the Hindu majority, critics say, at the expense of the millions who profess minority faiths.
Modi and his BJP have repeatedly said they do not discriminate against minority groups.
The BJP’s national spokesperson, Jaiveer Shergill, condemned the report on Monday, saying it was published to malign India’s image.
“India as a nation has a very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost,” Shergill told CNN. “Today’s India does not need any certification from any ‘anti-India reports industry’ which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India’s image.”

According to the report, hate speech last year reinforced “longstanding Hindu nationalist tropes” such as the portrayal of Muslims and Christians as “outsiders,” “foreigners” and “invaders” who lack a legitimate claim to belonging in India, the report said.
It found that the BJP organized around 30% of last year’s hate speech events, a nearly six-fold increase from the year prior, with itsparty leaders delivering452 hate speeches, a 350% rise from the previous year. The majority were recorded during the general election campaign.
Modi has in the pastbeen accused of making Islamophobic remarksin speeches on the campaign trail.
“These high-profile hate speeches (by Modi and powerful regional leaders) were further amplified and reinforced by an arsenal of local BJP leaders, Hindu far-right organizations, and religious figures, who spread similar rhetoric at community and grassroots levels,” the report found.
Muslims make up roughly 200 million of India’s 1.4 billion population, with the population of Christians at roughly 27 million.
Under Modi’s leadership,Hindu nationalistshave been appointed to top positions in key government institutions, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation that rights groups say unfairly target Muslims. Textbooks have been rewritten to downplay the history of India’s former Islamic rulers, cities and streets with Mughal-era names renamed and Muslim properties have been demolished by authorities forillegal encroachment on government landand as punishment for alleged rioting.
In 2019, Modi removed the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir – India’s only Muslim-majority state – bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. That same year, his administration passed a controversial citizenship law that excluded Muslim migrants, sparking deadly riots.
India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section that criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs.
However, some experts say hate speech has proliferated in India as a result of the judiciary’s reluctance to recognize hate speech offenses.
Anas Tanwir, a lawyer and founder of the Indian Civil Liberties Union, said the judiciary has failed to take concrete action against hate speech “despite clear prohibitions under various laws in India.”
The India Hate Lab, a project under the Washington, DC-based think tank Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), releases annual data on hate speech in the world’s largest democracy. They define hate speech by the United Nations framework which looks at any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language based on a person’s religion.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/asia/trump-china-warships-asia-pacific-analysis-hnk-intl/index.html,"Chinese warships have been circumnavigating Australia’s coastline for more than three weeks, passing within 200 miles of Sydney,and staging unprecedentedlive-fire drillson its doorstep with New Zealand.
The exercises, which camewithout formal notice, have caused deep consternation in both nations. Suddenly, thespecter of China’s military power was no longer confinedto the distant waters of the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait – where China’s territorial aggression has escalated under leader Xi Jinping – but a stark reality unfolding much closer to home.
At the same time, Chinese warships have been sighted near Vietnam andTaiwan, part of a show of Chinese naval strength in the Pacific region that regularly rattles US allies.
China was unapologetic and insisted it complied with international law, withstate media suggestingWestern countries should get used to Chinese warships in nearby waters.
In the past, Washington’s partners have found comfort in their firm ties with the US, but that was before Donald Trump’sexplosive meetingwith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the US leader’s subsequent order tohalt aid to Ukraineas it battles Russia’s invasion.
The bust-up in the Oval Office served to sharpen anxieties in capitals across the Pacific: If the US is willing to turn its back on Ukraine – effectively rewarding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Europe – would it do the same in Asia when faced with a belligerent Beijing?
Trump’sembrace of Russiaand hiscold shoulder to Europe– driven by a transactional approach that Singapore’s defense minister likened to a “landlord seeking rent” – has heightened trepidation in the Indo-Pacific region, where many nations look to the US to keep Chinese aggression in check.
“It does raise issues as to whether the US will be committed to regional security. And even if the US remains committed, what will the Trump administration ask in return?” said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
Experts say it’s a fair question from allies who’ve long relied on the US to provide security assurances, enabling them to limit their own defense spending.
Now might be the time, they add, for American partners, like Australia and New Zealand, to reexamine budgets and tighten regional alliances with other countries that could find themselves exposed as Trump pursues his “America first” mantra.
Australia has made sure the world is aware of China’s movements in international waters in the South Pacific, issuing daily location updates from trailing Australian Navy ships and spy planes.
Defense Minister Richard Marles said the data would be analyzed to determine exactly what China was doing – and what message it was intending to send.
China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian,maintainedthat China posed no threat to Australia while signaling that more warship visits should be expected. “As a major power in this region…it is normal for China to send their vessels to different parts of the region to conduct various kinds of activities,” Xiaotold Australia’s public broadcaster the ABC.
Across the Pacific in Washington, Trump was sending his own message to US partners in Europe that they needed to step up military spending in defense of Ukraine.
Before his fractious meeting with Zelensky, Trump had intended to sign a mineral resources deal with the Ukrainian leader so that the US could recoup some of the cost of its aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. But the signing ceremony was abandoned, with Trump telling Zelensky on his social platform Truth Social to “come back when he is ready for Peace.”
By subsequently cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump was seeking to force rich European nations to shoulder more of the load, say experts.
“He believes they have all been free riding off the United States for half a century,” said Peter Dean, the director of foreign policy and defense at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.
The move seemed to reap rewards when on Tuesday theEuropean Union unveiled a plan to allow member states to borrow€150 billion ($158 billion) to boost their defense spending and “massively step up” their military support for Kyiv.
Dean says Trump wants a deal for peace in Ukraine; however, he’s ignoring Zelensky’s concerns about the longevity of that peace without measures to keep Putin in check.
“It seems to be that (Trump) almost wants peace at any price, rather than a peace that is fair and equitable, or a peace that you keep,” he said. “The question is, what does the deal look like? And that’s what everyone’s worried about. How much is he willing to trade away?”
As Trump upends the transatlantic alliance – a pillar of Western security for decades – his administration has signaled that the US should wrap up conflicts elsewhere to focus on deterring China in the Pacific.
The urgency of that aim was highlighted by China’s latest flexing of its military muscle.
“It’s a test of resolve, for sure,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at RSIS in Singapore, of China’s military drills. “China (is) carving out a sphere of influence in the Pacific to test to see if countries in the region are going to resist it.”
Even before Trump’s clash with Zelensky, the presence of Chinese warships on its southern coast had turned Australia’s attention to AUKUS, its multibillion-dollar security deal with the US and the United Kingdom.
Concerns had flared about whether the deal could withstand the whims of Trump’s White House when a British reporter asked the US president if he and his UK counterpart had spoken about AUKUS.
“What does that mean?” Trump replied. The incident was later brushed off byTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent as an issue of accents.“I think we’re going to have to limit the questions to Americans he can understand,” he said.
Dean, from the University of Sydney, said it’s no bad thing that Trump wasn’t across the acronym because the deal already has the fulsome support of his closest advisers.
That support was cemented by Australia’s first down payment of $500 million to bolster America’s submarine production, with the agreement that some nuclear-powered subs will be sold to Australia to boost its military capability in the Indo-Pacific.
It’s the kind of deal Trump will want to focus on in the future, Dean said.
“He’s looking to make money for the United States, and he’s looking to do better deals. And AUKUS is a bit of an exemplar deal for them,” Dean said.
“For the Europeans, I wouldn’t underestimate Donald Trump looking at this and going, if the Australians can do this, why can’t you?”
Elsewhere across the Pacific, US allies appeared unsettled by the extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba struck a cautious tone on Monday, insisting he had “no intention of taking sides” when asked about the Trump-Zelensky clash.
Yet, he vowed to do his utmost to “maintain US involvement and promote unity” among the Group of Seven nations – hinting at growing disquiet over the fracturing of the Western alliance.
“Today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s East Asia,” he added. “We must also consider steadily increasing our deterrent power to prevent war.”
Japan, which has territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea, has raised concern about increasing Chinese military maneuvers in its nearby waters. Last year, a Chinese aircraft carrier entered Japan’s contiguous watersfor the first time.
South Korea, another US ally in East Asia, declined to comment on the meeting between Trump and Zelensky but said it was closely monitoring US suspension of military aid to Ukraine.
Trump has repeatedly called on allies like South Korea to pay more for US troops stationed on their territory. In a speech to Congress on Wednesday, he once again made a veiled threat while referencing what he called unfair tariffs South Korea places on US goods – something Seoul denies.
“We give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that’s what happened, this is happening by friend and foe,” Trump said.
In Taiwan, the self-governing democracy China has vowed to one day absorb, Defense Minister Wellington Koo tried to reassure confidence despite what he described as “rapid and bizarre changes” in the international landscape.
“I think the United States won’t retreat from the Indo-Pacific region, because this is its core interests,” he told reporters in a briefing Tuesday, citing shared interests with Washington in economic development, geopolitics and US military security.
But Koo also nodded to Trump’s “America first” stance. “In international politics, we also deeply realize that we can’t just talk about values and not talk about interests. Of course, the United States must value its own national interests,” he added.
Experts say the US has become frustrated at having to shoulder the weight of other countries who fail to contribute to their own defense.
“The Trump administration has made clear its lack of tolerance. It’s had no tolerance for free riders,” said Thompson, from RSIS in Singapore.
“I think the countries that get that message clearest and fastest are the ones that are going to be the good partners of the United States, because it’s not like the US is abandoning allies. What the US is doing is prioritizing its most capable ones,” Thompson said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/27/asia/indonesia-caning-gay-sex-intl-latam/index.html,"BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — Two men in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province were publicly caned Thursday after an Islamic Shariah court convicted them for having sex with each other.
Dozens of people witnessed the caning at a hall in Banda Aceh’s Bustanussalatin city park. It’s the fourth time that Aceh, the only province in Indonesia to practice Shariah law, has caned people for homosexuality since the Islamic law was implemented in 2006 as a concession made by the government to end a long-running separatist rebellion.
The men, aged 24 and 18, were whipped across the back dozens of times by a team of five enforcers wearing robes and hoods. They were given a break to drink after 20 strokes and their wounds were treated.

The men were arrested in November after residents suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room, where they were caught naked and hugging each other, and took them to Sharia police.
A Shariah court on Monday sentenced the two college students to receive 85 and 80 strokes respectively, but they were caned 82 and 77 times after a remission for time spent in prison. One of the men had to be carried because he was too weak to move after the last lash.
Two other people were also sentenced to 34 and 8 strokes each for gambling.
Indonesia’s secular central government granted Aceh the right to implement Islamic Shariah law in 2006 as part of a peace deal to end a decades-long separatist war. A religious police and court system have been established, and the law was a significant strengthening of Shariah in the region.
Aceh implemented an expansion of Islamic bylaws and criminal code in 2015 that extended Shariah law to the province’s non-Muslims, who account for about 1% of the population. The region allows up to 100 lashes for morality offenses including gay sex and sex between unmarried people.
Caning is also a punishment in Aceh for gambling, drinking alcohol, women who wear tight clothes and men who skip Friday prayers.

Human rights groups have criticized the law, saying it violates international treaties signed by Indonesia protecting the rights of minorities.

However, an earlier version of the law that called for people to be stoned to death for adultery was dropped because of pressure from the central government.",asia

Yoon’s December 3 decree threwSouth Koreainto turmoil when he banned political activity and sent troops to the heart of the nation’s democracy – only to reverse the move within six hours after lawmakers forced their way into parliament and voted unanimously to block it.
The decree was swiftly met by widespread public anger, reviving painful memories of strongmen leaders who curtailed rights and freedoms in the country after the Korean War until its transition to democracy in the late 1980s.
Even several members of Yoon’s own conservative ruling party turned on him. On December 14, parliament voted to impeach him, suspending his presidential powers.
But a defiant Yoon has vowed to “fight to the end,” as the country’s top court reviews his impeachment and as he also appears in a separate criminal trial for insurrection.
Here’s what we know.
South Korea’s Constitutional Court will decide whether to remove Yoon from office permanently or reinstate him. It is now reviewing his impeachment by parliament after hearing weeks of testimony by high-ranking current and former officials.
Lawyers for parliament have argued that if Yoon is reinstated, he could try to impose martial law again or undermine constitutional institutions.
Yoon has argued that he had a right as president to issue his martial law decree. The formerprosecutor-turned-politiciansaid his move was justified by political deadlock and threats from “anti-state forces” sympathetic to North Korea.
Lawyers for Yoon have also argued that he never actually intended to stop parliament from operating, even though the order was publicly declared, and troops and police were deployed to the legislature.
Yoon also sent troops to the National Election Commission and later said the decree was necessary, in part, because the body had been unwilling to address concerns over election hacking, a claimrejected by election officials.
A ruling in the impeachment case is expected in March.
If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon’s impeachment, he would become the shortest-serving president in South Korea’s democratic history, having taken office in May 2022. The country must then hold new presidential elections within 60 days.
If Yoon’s impeachment is upheld, it would also remove his immunity from most criminal charges.
Prosecutors indicted Yoon on separate criminal charges related to his martial law decree ofleading an insurrection. He wasarrested in Januaryafter a weeks-long standoff between investigators and his presidential security team. He has since been held in solitary confinement at a detention center near Seoul.
Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.
The indictment alleges that Yoon’s imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. Yoon has said his decree was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he always planned to respect lawmakers’ will if they voted to lift the measure.
Yoon’s lawyers have also repeatedly argued that his arrest was politically motivated and that the warrant was invalid because of flaws in the way the investigation was conducted.
The next preliminary hearing for the criminal proceedings is set for the end of March.
Yoon’s insurrection trial is expected to take months. A verdict could be reached by late 2025 or early 2026, according to legal analysts.
Meanwhile, the court is reviewing a request by Yoon’s lawyers to revoke his arrest order and release him from custody, though such challenges are rarely successful.
The impeachment proceedings offered dramatic details illustrating how Yoon and the military enacted the ultimately short-lived martial law order.
South Korea’s former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said it was he, not the president, who first proposed the ill-fated brief period of military rule.
Kim said he wrote the controversial decree himself, which included a sweeping ban of political activity across South Korea.
“All political activities, including the activities of the National Assembly, local councils, and political parties, political associations, rallies and demonstrations, are prohibited,” the martial law decree said.
Both Yoon and Kim strongly denied ordering military commanders to “drag out” lawmakers inside the National Assembly. However, former Army Commander Kwak Jong-geun consistently testified he received direct orders from Yoon himself to forcibly remove assembly members.
Kim and lawyers for Yoon maintained the order was misheard – arguing the Korean word for lawmakers was confused with the similar sounding word for agents or soldiers.
Former first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS) Hong Jang-won also repeatedly testified Yoon told him to take advantage of martial law. He said Yoon described it as an opportunity to “arrest” a list of 14 political and legal adversaries and to “clean everything up” - which Yoon denies.
Possibly not: Yoon also faces the prospect of another legal battle.
Police have been investigating Yoon on suspicion of the special obstruction of public duty since around January 3, a police spokesperson told Reuters on February 22.
The crime is punishable by up to five years in jail.
A South Korean courtissued an arrest warrantfor Yoon on December 31 in the criminal investigation over his martial law decree. The warrant, however, was not executeduntil January 15after Yoon did not comply, remaining holed up in his heavily fortified presidential compound as the Presidential Security Service blocked investigators for days.
In the months since Yoon’s martial law declaration, South Korea has been in political disarray with parliament also voting to impeach its prime minister and acting president Han Duck-soo. Finance minister Choi Sang-mok is now acting president.

The two US Army active-duty soldiers were identified as Jian Zhao and Li Tian, stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Washington state. Zhao, a battery supply sergeant was assigned to the 17th Field Artillery Brigade and Tian is a health services administrator.
The former soldier, Ruoyu Duan of Hillsboro, Oregon, served in the Army from 2013 to 2017.

Tian and Duan were both charged with “conspiring to commit bribery and theft of government property.” Zhao faces the same charge and was also indicted for obtaining and transmitting “national defense information” to an “unnamed individual not authorized to receive it.”
According to anindictmentfiled Wednesday in the US District Court for Western Washington, Zhao, who managed over $55 million worth of army property, was accused of selling nearly two dozen classified hard drives marked “Secret” or “Top Secret,” as well as sensitive US military documents and information pertaining to High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to buyers in China, including one “co-conspirator” based in the city of Changchun.
The sergeant also allegedly obtained and sold information related to the US’s military readiness in the event of a conflict with China.
The indictment stated Zhao received payments totaling at least $15,000 from August 2024 onwards.
A separate indictment in the US District of Oregon noted that between November 2021 and at least December 19, 2024, Duan and Tian conspired together to steal and transmit sensitive military information on the US Army’s operational capabilities, including technical manuals.
The indictment alleges Tian also sent Duan links to Google Drive accounts containing sensitive information on US military weapons systems, such as Bradley and Stryker US Army fighting vehicles.
“The defendants arrested today are accused of betraying our country, actively working to weaken America’s defense capabilities and empowering our adversaries in China,” Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi said in a news release.
“They will face swift, severe, and comprehensive justice.”
“These arrests should send a message to would-be spies that we and our partners have the will and the ability to find you, track you down, and hold you to account.” said W. Mike Herrington, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Seattle Field Office. The case was investigated by the FBI and the Army Intelligence Command.
These arrests are among several cases in recent years involving people in the US armed services charged with sharing sensitive military information with others, including China.
In March 2024, a US Army sergeant was charged with leaking classified information about the military’s most advanced weapons to a foreign national claiming tolive in Hong Kong in exchange for $42,000.
In August 2023,two US Navy sailors were chargedwith sharing sensitive military information with a foreign country, one of whom allegedly sent blueprints of a US radar system in Japan, and aNational Guardsman was arrestedin April after allegedly posting a trove of classified documents on social media.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/25/india/maha-kumbh-mela-water-quality-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"Hundreds of millions of Hindu devotees have bathed in sacred waters, despite concerns over overcrowding and water pollution, as the world’s largest religious gathering wrapped up Wednesday in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
Over the last 45 days, more than 620 million people – over a third of India’s roughly 1.4 billion population - have attended theMaha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of theSacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj, in a spectacle of color and expression of faith.
Followers have come to take a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers – the Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati – to purify their sins and take another step closer to “spiritual liberation.”
Every 12 years the festival carries the prefix “Maha,” which means great, as it’s the largest gathering of the Kumbh Mela that’s held every three years in one of four cities.
“It is a unique, once in a lifetime experience,” said Sushovan Sircar, 36, who works as an independent consultant in Delhi. “People from all over India are here, as I saw number plates of cars from almost every state.”
Though this year’s festivities have been marred by two separate,deadly crowd crushes, millions have turned out for the festival despite concerns of overcrowding and reports of “unsafe” levels of contamination in key bathing sites.
A report from the Central Pollution and Control Board (CPCB), part of India’s Environment Ministry, last month found high levels of coliform faecal bacteria in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, despite the government touting sustainable initiatives and sanitation efforts.
Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath denied the accuracy of the government report, insisting that the water was not just safe for bathing, but also for the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing.
Attendees often submerge themselves fully, sometimes drinking or collecting the sacred water in containers.
Sircar, the independent consultant from Delhi, said he bathed in the water at Sangam point – the confluence of the three rivers considered to be the most auspicious place to bathe and where most people take their dip – twice last week.
“There is a concern because there is nothing I can do about the contamination in the water. In your mind you tell yourself, this part looks clean, spend a few minutes in, recite prayers and come out,” said Sircar.
“I took a shower for sins and then another shower for the contamination,” he laughed. “So you need a bath after the bath… My sins are cleansed, but not (my) body.”
Before the festival began, India’s top environmental court directed the state and federal pollution boards to ensure the river water was clean enough to drink and bathe in. It called for increasing monitoring and sample collecting of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and ensuring that no untreated sewage or solid waste would be discharged.
But a report submitted by the federal pollution board on February 3 stated that faecal coliform levels, a key indicator of untreated sewage and faecal matter in water, were far above the safe limit set by the board of 2,500 units per 100 millilitres.
At various parts of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers around Prayagraj levels were more than 1,000 over the safe limit, according to the report.
Adityanath said his government was continually monitoring the water levels to ensure its quality.

Kumbh Mela organizers also told CNN that an “exhaustive survey” of all 81 drains that release water in the rivers was carried out ahead of the festival.
“We have ensured that the water quality has been maintained,” said Kumbh Mela officer Vivek Chaturvedi.
Aishwary Sharma, 31, a finance professional in Delhi, said he took a dip in the rivers despite knowing it could be polluted.
“I think it is quite evident that the Ganga and Yamuna are not clean rivers,” he said.  “(But) there are many things that are bad for you… The air we breathe is so toxic for our health… It is just another thing that is polluted that could have a harmful impact on my health.”
For others, their faith and participating in the sacred festival was more important than their concerns.
“What (most people) are interested in is their devotion and religion and that they want to take that holy dip,” said Sunny Parasher, 34, from Panchkula in Haryana state.
“Where there is devotion, where there is religion, there is no question,” he said.
Kalpana Mishra, 55, a housewife from Prayagraj, said she would not take another holy dip after reading the pollution board’s report.
“What does being a literate person mean if you hear all this and still decide to go?” she asked.
Exposure to faecal contamination can cause water borne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea, cholera, gastroenteritis, E-coli, skin disease and vomiting, health experts warn.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made cleaning the Ganges, India’s holiest river, a priority since first taking office in 2014 – with billions of dollars spent or pledged on sewage treatment, cleaning surface waste and afforestation in the decade since.
The Ganges, a lifeline for 400 million people who live and work along it, runs through 50 Indian cities that pump out about 3 billion liters of sewage every day – only a fraction of which is treated before it reaches the river, according to the World Bank.
The Yamuna, a tributary of the Ganges, has also for decades been plagued by the dumping of toxic chemicals and untreated sewage.
Ahead of the festival, Indian authorities touted this year’s gathering as a “Green Kumbh,” with sustainable initiatives such as a ban on single-use plastics, eco-friendly toilets, electric rickshaws and an army of 15,000 sanitation workers hired to clean up after major bathing days.
The Ministry of Culture said in January that the festival had been “meticulously planned to uphold hygiene and ecological balance” and would “set an example for future large-scale events worldwide” in environmental responsibility.
Protecting and cleaning the river was even a major theme at a conference held on the sidelines of the festival with religious and environmental leaders coming together for the first time on how religious institutions can address the climate crisis.
“If there is no water in the rivers, there is no Kumbh. We don’t consider it water, we consider it nectar,” said Indian spiritual leader Swami Chidanand Saraswati at the meeting. “If we all do not make efforts to protect it, then the next (Kumbh Mela) will be on mere sand.”
But complicating the green efforts was the enormous crowd size at this year’s Kumbh Mela, which saw 250 million more people than originally expected, according to one expert. Authorities had planned for about 400 million people to attend over the six-week gathering, with about 9 million people per day, but about 620 million people attended in total, according to government figures.
“It is a mammoth task to take care of such a crowd,” said Dr Nupur Bahadur, an associate director with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a research institute that looks at wastewater management, established by the Indian government.
River contamination could be better managed by adopting better on-site prevention and disinfection methods, Bahadur said.
One of them could be halting the dip after every 12 hours for one hour” and letting fresh water run through the bathing areas before “the dips can be restarted,” she said.
Bahadur said that while the festival’s “massive increase in footfall” strained its infrastructure, it has still been “the best human effort possible” in such a situation.
Prayagraj resident Mishra said she will be happy when her city gets back to normal.
“My eyes are constantly burning and there is so much dust,” she said. “I want the festival to end so I can get back to my life.”",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/asia/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-released-detention-intl-hnk/index.html,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who lawmakers voted toimpeach and was indicted on criminal chargesfor declaring martial law last December, was cleared to be released from detention on Friday.
Yoon has been in detention since being arrested in January on charges of leading an insurrection – one of the few criminal charges the president does not have immunity from. However, the Seoul Central District Court on Friday canceled his arrest warrant, allowing for his release, according to a court ruling reviewed by CNN.
In its ruling, the court said it was questionable whether the insurrection charges indictment was filed after the defendant’s detention period had expired. It therefore canceled Yoon’s arrest warrant to “ensure procedural clarity and eliminate doubts regarding the legality of the investigation process,” it said.
Yoon’s lawyers had also argued that the crime of insurrection is not included within the investigative jurisdiction of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) – the agency that had requested the arrest warrant against the leader. In its ruling, the court said the question of jurisdiction was unclear, as there are no provisions in current laws about this issue, and no previous ruling from the Supreme Court.
Any further unresolved “legal controversies” during the criminal trial could “serve as grounds for annulment in a higher court and may also provide grounds for a retrial even after a significant amount of time has passed,” it added.
The court will now send its ruling to the detention center – which said it expects to release Yoon by the end of Friday after receiving the documents.
Yoon’s lawyers praised the ruling, saying in a statement that the court had “set the definition straight, declaring what laws and principles are,” and that its decision showed “the rule of law is alive in this country.”
The ruling adds to the uncertainty swirling around Yoon’s various legal battles and the country’s political future. South Korea’s government has been in disarray for months, with parliament also voting to impeach its prime minister and the previous acting president.

Yoon’s criminal charges are separate from his impeachment trial. The country’s highest court, the Constitutional Court, is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether to uphold his impeachment or reinstate Yoon to office.
Friday’s ruling means Yoon can now await the impeachment verdict from home instead of in detention.
His expected release will undoubtedly dismay the country’s opposition.
South Korea’s main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung said: “Just because the prosecutors made a rudimentary calculation mistake does not eliminate the clear fact that President Yoon Suk Yeol destroyed the constitutional order through an unconstitutional military coup.”
“Insurrection is still happening, and overcoming it is our most important task right now,” Lee added.
Meanwhile, Yoon’s expected released will be celebrated by supporters, many of whom have regularly gathered outside his detention center since January.
Kwon Young-se, chairman of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party, welcomed the court’s decision on Friday, calling it “an important moment to confirm that the rule of law and justice of the Republic of Korea are alive.”
He added that he hoped the Constitutional Court “will make a fair and just ruling based solely on constitutional values” during the impeachment trial.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/europe/russia-strikes-ukrainians-killed-zelensky-intl/index.html,"Russian missiles killed 11 people overnight in strikes on Ukraine’s eastern city of Dobropillia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday, saying such attacks “prove that Russia’s goals are unchanged.”
The attacks come as the Ukrainian war is at a critical point, with the United States having halted military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv as part of efforts to pressure it into accepting a peace agreement. The move has left Ukraine even more vulnerable to Russian attacks.
On Friday, after threatening Russia with sanctions to force through a ceasefire, US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody else would do” in taking advantage of the current battlefield dynamics.
In addition to those killed, the latest strikes injured more than 30 others, Zelensky said, including five children.
Authorities said that more people could be trapped under the rubble, with at least eight residential buildings in the area damaged in the attack.
The Ukrainian president described the strikes as “a vile and inhumane tactic of intimidation that Russians often use.”
“Therefore, it is crucial to continue to do everything to protect lives, strengthen our air defense, and increase sanctions against Russia,” Zelensky said, adding that “everything that helps Putin finance the war must break.”
Zelensky has said he will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia next week ahead of negotiations between Kyiv and Washington. After that, his team will stay in Saudi Arabia “to work with our American partners,” he added.

Local officials said on Saturday that over the past day, Russian attacks had killed at least 23 people and injured more than 50 in eastern and southern Ukraine.
In addition to those killed in Dobropillia, Russian attacks elsewhere in Donetsk killed nine others and wounded 13, according to local authorities.
Ukraine’s emergency service said that a drone attack in the eastern Kharkiv region also killed three people and injured seven, while five people were injured in attacks on the southern Kherson region, according to local officials.
Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 79 out of 145 drones launched by Russia overnight, while 54 drones did not reach their target.
Russia also used at least three missiles in its attack, the air force said, adding that it shot down at least one of the projectiles.
The attacks came just days after a deadly Russian airstrike on Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Zelensky.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in the Russian region of Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.
Although the invasion may have slowed Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, Kyiv has since lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk. Moscow has called in foreign reinforcements anddeployed some 12,000 North Korean troopsto the region, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports.
This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/27/asia/thailand-deporting-uyghurs-china-intl-hnk/index.html,"The secret deportation by Thailand of dozens of Uyghurs to China that has sparked international condemnation is a diplomatic win for Beijing and a snub to the United States and the United Nations, who had long warned that the men would face torture and imprisonment if they were returned home.
The 40 men had fled China in 2014, arriving in Thailand where they were arrested and later spent more than a decade in detention and in legal limbo.
In the early hours of Thursday they were reportedly taken in trucks to an airport in Bangkok and put on a plane, with Thai officials later confirming they had deported “40 ethnic Uyghur Chinese nationals” following an official request from Beijing.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spearheaded legislation advocating for the protection of the rights of Uyghur people while he was a senator, and told his Senate confirmation hearing ahead of being sworn in as secretary of state that he would lobby Bangkok against deporting the Uyghur men.
Rubio condemned the move “in the strongest possible terms,” adding that Uyghurs in China “have faced persecution, forced labor, and torture” while lacking due process rights.
China’s repression of Uyghurs and other predominately Muslim ethnic minorities in its far western region of Xinjiang has been labeled “genocide” by the US and other countries, with widespread and credible reports of arbitrary detention,mass surveillance,forced laborand restrictions on movement – allegations China vehemently denies.
“We urge all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China,” Rubio said.
Related articleShe tweeted from Sweden about the plight of her Uyghur cousin. In Xinjiang, the authorities were watching
UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the deportations violated legislation Thailand had signed up to prohibiting the return of people to places where they may face torture or ill-treatment.
He said his office had repeatedly urged Thai authorities to “respect their obligations under international law in relation to these individuals in need of international protection.”
“It is deeply regrettable that they have been forcibly returned,” he said.
In response, China’s Foreign Ministry on Friday blasted “some countries and international organizations” for “fabricating lies about Xinjiang and politicizing the issue.” Genocide and forced labor are the “lie of the century,” a spokesperson for the ministry told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Thursday said that 40 Chinese nationals who had illegally entered Thailand were deported and repatriated to China, without mentioning their ethnicity.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra didn’t confirm any deportations.
But on Friday she admitted she had been aware all along but could not comment publicly, citing protocol and national security concerns.
She added that she had discussed the deportations with Chinese officials during a visit to China in early February, and that the officials had guaranteed the safety of the Uyghurs once they had arrived in China.
Thailand is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and does not recognize the concept of asylum. The Southeast Asian kingdom has a history of pushing refugees back across its borders and of deporting dissidents.
In 2015, Thailand deported over 100 Uyghurs to China, sparking international outcry. The fate and whereabouts of those returned are unknown, UN expertssaidlast year.
Thailand has long been a draw forinvestmentfrom Beijing, playing a part in China’sBelt and Road Initiative, a vast overseas infrastructure development program that launched more than a decade ago.
For nearly a decade before the pandemic, China was also Thailand’s largest source of foreign tourists, a crucial driver of the kingdom’s economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism.
Following the deportations Rubio called on Beijing to protect the Uyghurs’ human rights and provide “full access” to verify their well-being “on a regular basis.”
The deported men were part of a larger group of about 350 people detained after they arrived in Thailand, some of whom were minors, according to previous reports fromUN experts,rights groups, and Uyghur campaigners.
Five Uyghur detainees, including a newborn and a 3-year-old, have died in detention, the reports said.
Human rights groups and campaigners say that in the years since, the men had been held “in life-threatening conditions” without access to lawyers, family members or UN representatives.
In January, as reports emerged Thailand was planning the deportations, dozens of the detained Uyghurs wrote a letter to the international community.
“We urgently appeal to all international organizations and countries concerned with human rights to intervene immediately to save us from this tragic fate before it is too late,” they wrote.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/tech/china-state-venture-capital-guidance-fund-intl-hnk/index.html,"Fresh off the global success ofDeepSeek’slatest artificial intelligence reasoning model, China’s top economic officials have vowed to set up a state-backed fund to support technological innovation.
The “state venture capital guidance fund” will focus on cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum technology and hydrogen energy storage, Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s state economic planner, told reporters Thursday on the sidelines of the annual gatherings of China’s rubber-stamp national legislature and advisory body.
The fund is expected to attract nearly 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) in capital over 20 years from local governments and the private sector, added Zheng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission.
Chinese leaders see high-end chips, quantum computing, robotics and AI as critical to powering economic growth and upgrading manufacturing. But China is facing mounting pressure from US tech restrictions.
Zheng struck a defiant tone at the news conference, hailing China’s rapid development in microchips and AI large language models as well as industrial and humanoid robots.
“Scenes once only seen in science fiction are now becoming reality. We are steadily moving toward the global frontiers of technology and innovation,” Zheng said. “This proves that the suppression and blockade attempt by certain forces only serve to accelerate our drive for independent innovation,” he added in an apparent reference to the United States.
DeepSeek, a privately owned company whoseR1 large language modelroiled global stock marketswhen it was introduced in January, was able to nearly match the capabilities of its rivals – including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost.
Related articleDeepSeek hasn’t just disrupted OpenAI. Chinese tech giants are being upended too
That surprised observers because the US has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips.
On Wednesday, China’s Premier Li Keqiang pledged to “foster emerging industries and industries of the future” as he delivered the government’s annual work report. Li promised to establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries such as bio-manufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI and 6G technology.
After years of prioritizing tech innovation over domestic demand, China’s leaders have also started to show more commitment to strengthening consumption as their top policy task. The Chinese government will soon unveil a “special action plan to boost consumption,” said Zheng, the economic official.
Last year, despite a Septemberstimulus push, much of the country’s growth momentum came from exports, which propelled China’s trade surplus to arecord highof just under $1 trillion. That strength has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump, who this week doubled US import tariffs on Chinese goods to 20%.
China’s household consumption as a share of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at just 39% in 2023, the most recent year for which data was available, according to the Macquarie Group, an investment bank. That compares with 49% for South Korea and 55% for Japan, two Asian countries with already high savings rates, and 68% for the United States.
“Beijing is determined to find strength from within amid rising external uncertainties. China is launching special actions to boost domestic consumption,” HSBC economists led by Jing Liu wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
As part of those efforts, China raised its budget deficit to around 4% of gross domestic product, Premier Li announced in his work report. It was the highest level in decades and part of a plan to ramp up spending to counter the impact of US tariffs.

He also indicated that the quota for government bond issuance would be raised by more than 25% from last year to 6.2 trillion yuan ($855 billion), split between the local and central authorities.
Special bonds issued by local governments will be used for infrastructure investment and to help the struggling housing market, while the central authorities would earmark around 300 billion yuan ($41 billion) to spend on consumer subsidies for a popular “cash-for-clunkers” trade-in program for cars and consumer electronics.
Key to the government’s success will be whether it is able revive the “animal spirits” of China’s private entrepreneurs, who will need to advance technological innovation as Beijing gears up for more restrictions from the US.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinpinghostedthe country’s top tech executives in the capital, where he proclaimed it was “prime time” for private enterprises “to give full play to their capabilities.”
Private businesses contribute more than 60% to China’s GDP and over 80% of employment, despite being dwarfed by the state sector in size. However, many companies, particularly in the tech sector, are still recovering after a severe regulatory crackdown that lasted more than three years.
The Private Economy Promotion Law, which is due to be discussed during the ongoing “two sessions” political meetings, would ensure companies are legally supported and protected, according to Yang Decai, a director of the Private Economic Research Institute at Nanjing University and member of an advisory body to the legislature.
It “responds very promptly and effectively to some issues that the private sector is concerned about, such as property rights protection, fair competition,” he told journalists on Tuesday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. “This has boosted the confidence of private enterprises and our expectations for the market, which is of great significance to the stable growth of the Chinese economy.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/world/russia-aerial-assault-ukraine-us-pause-military-aid-intl/index.html,"Russia fired cruise and ballistic missiles atUkrainein a major overnight attack, Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday, as the Ukrainian president renewed his plea for a partial ceasefire at the end of a week in which theUnited Statessuspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.
Russia’s assault targeted several regions across Ukraine, using nearly 70 missiles and almost 200 drones, Zelensky said on X, adding that the “massive” attack was “directed against infrastructure that ensures normal life.”
Following the strikes, Zelensky again stressed his desire for a partial ceasefire – a plan first floated by French President Emmanuel Macron and since discussed by Ukraine’s European allies, who met Thursday in Brussels for a crucial European Union defense summit.
Echoing the plan outlined by Macron, Zelensky said he hoped there can be “silence in the skies – banning the use of missiles, long-range drones and aerial bombs,” as well as “silence at sea – a real guarantee of normal navigation.”
Related articleCan NATO survive without the United States?
He added later Friday that “the most intensive work ever” is underway with US President Donald Trump’s teamahead of Zelensky’s visitto Saudi Arabia next week for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.
But the Trump administration has dealt further blows to Ukraine this week, pausing military shipments to the country and cutting off intelligence sharing.
The White House also has suspended Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery purchased by the US government through the company Maxar, spokespeople for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Maxar said Friday. Kyiv has long used this overhead imagery to track Russian troop movements, assess terrain and help in the planning of military operations.
After weeks of more amicable relations with Russia, Trump issued a surprising threat to Moscow on Friday, saying “based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine,” he is considering placing large-scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and final peace settlement.
“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,” Trump said on TruthSocial.
But despite Trump’s harsh tone, the prospect of higher tariffs will mean little to Moscow, given the tiny amounts of trade between the US and Russia. Last year, Russia exported just $3.5 billion of goods to the US, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.
The halting of American military equipment may have devastating effects on Ukraine’s capabilities andcould leave millions of civiliansvulnerable to Russian missile strikes.
Russia’s overnight barrage included 43 cruise missiles, including eight Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as three Iskander ballistic missiles and 194 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force.
The air force said it downed 134 projectiles, including 25 of the cruise missiles, all eight Kalibr missiles, a guided aircraft missile and 100 drones – but it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound.
However, it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound. The only weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal capable of downing ballistic missiles is the US-made Patriot system, which were already in short supply before the US cut off military aid to Kyiv.
Zelensky said that F-16 fighter jets, as well as Mirage aircraft provided by France, had been used to help repel the attack, and that the Mirages had successfully intercepted some of the cruise missiles.
In the late hours of Friday, Russian strikes on the city of Dobropillia in eastern Ukraine killed at least five people and injured another 18, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin, said in a Telegram post. Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa also endured a wave of drone attacks late on Friday, said the head of the Odesa region military administration Oleh Kiper.
Russia’s Defense Ministry meanwhile said its air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones over several regions in a span of two and a half hours on Friday.
Over the week since Zelensky’s disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Ukrainian leader has tacked more closely to his European allies. Led by Macron, several European leaders are pushing for a one-month ceasefire that could pave the way for a more lasting peace.
“The first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life. And this is something that can be effectively monitored,” Zelensky said after the overnight attack.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces in the Russian region, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.
Although the invasion may have slowed Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, Kyiv has since lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk, after Moscow called in foreign reinforcements and deployed some 12,000 North Korean troops to the region.
This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.
“The situation in the Kursk sector is very difficult – Russian troops have entered Sumy region,” Andriy Tsaplienko, a prominent Ukrainian military blogger, wrote on Telegram on Friday.
Tsaplienko warned that “Russian troops are rushing towards the road to Sudzha,” a major town in Kursk, in order to “cut off the Ukrainian bridgehead.” He added that Russia is “also trying to reach Zhuravka,” a village in Ukraine’s Sumy region just a few hundred meters from the Russia-Ukraine border.
In a major report last month, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, estimated that Ukraine has at most 30,000 troops stationed in the region, while Russia has gathered around 78,000 troops, including the North Koreans.
One Russian military blogger suggested that Moscow’s gains could be tied to the United States’ decision this week to pause intelligence sharing with Ukraine’s military.
“The breakthrough in Kursk regions… occurred exactly two days after the Americans stopped issuing target designations for cruise missiles and missiles of the ‘HIMARS’ system on the territory of Kursk region,” Yuriy Podolyka wrote on Telegram.
In the face of Russia’s gains, some Ukrainian bloggers have suggested that the Kursk incursion may have exhausted its strategic value.
“I didn’t think I would ever say this. But maybe it’s time to ‘close the shop’ from the Kursk direction. It’s hard for our guys there,” said Serhii Flesh. “As a diversion of enemy resources, I think this operation has long since justified itself.  As a political bargaining card, it is now questionable.”",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/china/china-two-sessions-xi-jinping-trump-trade-war-intl-hnk/index.html,"As US President Donald Trumpratcheted upeconomic pressure onChinaover the past week, Beijing sent back its own message: Its rise won’t be interrupted.
Amajor political meetingtaking place in the capital was the ideal backdrop for Beijing to respond. The “two sessions” gathering of China’s rubber-stamp legislature and its top political advisory body is where the governmentreveals its plansand sets the tone for the year ahead.
The top item on its priority list? Boosting consumer demand to ensure China doesn’t need to rely on exports to power its vast but slowing economy. And the next: driving forward leader Xi Jinping’s bid to transform the country into a technological superpower, by ramping up investment andenlisting the private sector.
Beijing is making these moves as it prepares for what could be a protracted economic showdown with the United States. Trump doubled additional tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% on Tuesday and has threatened more to come – as well astighter controlson American investment in China.
“We can prevail over any difficulty in pursuing development,” China’s No. 2 official Li Qiang told thousands of delegates seated in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People at theopening meetingof the National People’s Congress Wednesday. The “giant ship of China’s economy” will “sail steadily toward the future,” he said.
A foreign ministry spokesperson was more direct when asked about trade frictions on Tuesday: “If the US insists on waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China willfight till the end,” he told reporters.
And while Beijing’s priorities – and rhetoric – may echo those of years past, this time they are coming from a country that is starting to regain its swagger after being battered by its own Covid restrictions, a property sector crisis and by a tech war with the US.
“Confidence” has been an unofficial buzzword of the weeklong event, which ends Tuesday. It was used nearly a dozen times during a press conference held by China’s economic tsars on Thursday, splashed across state media coverage and included in a pointed reminder – that “confidence builds strength”– during the closing lines of Li’s nationally broadcast speech.
That optimism might be more aspiration than reality. Many in China are looking to the future with uncertainty. They’re more willing tosave than spend, while young people are struggling to find jobs and feeling unsure whether their lives will be better than those of their parents.
But unlike last year, the country is entering 2025 buoyed by the market-moving successes of Chinese firms and technology. And while Trump’s return has Beijing concerned about economic risks, it’s also eyeing opportunity for its own rise.
“By the end of Trump’s second term, America’s global standing and credibility image will have gone down,” People’s Liberation Army Sen. Col. (ret) Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Tsinghua University’s Center for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, told CNN. “And as American strength declines, China, of course, will look more important.”
This mood isn’t just percolating in the halls of power.
On the streets of the capital, gleaming homegrown electric vehicles weave through traffic, including those from carmaker BYD, which nowgoes toe-to-toewith Elon Musk’s Tesla for global sales – a reminder of China’s successful push to become a leader in green tech.
Then there’s the box office record-smashinganimation “Ne Zha 2”and the breakout success of privately ownedChinese AI firm DeepSeek.Its large language model shocked Silicon Valley and upended Western assumptions about the costs associated with AI.
In Beijing this week, “you can ask DeepSeek” has been a playful and proud punchline in casual conversation.
“Last year, people may have been impacted by the US narrative that China is declining, that China has peaked,” said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. “We still have many difficulties. We still have many problems, of course, but it’s not that we’ve reached peak China.”
Even Trump’s focus on economic rivalry with Beijing as he rolls out tariffs on US trade partners appears to some as a mark of how far China has come. On a recent weekday afternoon in downtown Beijing, some passersby interviewed by CNN pointed to competition with the US as a sign of their country’s growing strength.
“China is developing quickly now and that’s attracted international attention, especially from the United States,” but that may not be a bad thing, said a medical graduate student surnamed Xia. “Trump’s increase on tariffs is competition … (and) if there’s no competition maybe China’s independent development is not sustainable.”
But even as Chinese officials seek to project confidence, international observers say the economic stimulus measures announced this week show Beijing is girding itself for major challenges to come.
Premier Li alluded to that in his opening address. “The external environment is becoming more complex and severe, which may have a greater impact on the country’s trade, science and technology and other fields,” he said.
China doesn’t want to deal with that volatility while also grappling with a weak economy at home. That’s one reason why it’s trying to boost consumption and spur growth, setting an ambitious expansion target of“around 5%”this year. Beijing is also aware that trade frictions mean the economy needs to rely less on exports.
“It is likely that Beijing has thought through the scenarios of Trade War 2.0, but whatever happens, it is clear that China’s growth will have to rely more on domestic demand,” said Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University Singapore and former World Bank country director for China, in anote.
Still, some analysts say Beijing’s initiatives are short on details and much less aggressive than needed to rev up the economy and boost consumer confidence.
“It adds up to a sense by the leadership that they want to refocus on growth and development, but still a desire to do only as much as necessary in terms of stimulus to get there,” said Michael Hirson, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.
Xi may also be balancing this goal with another concern: a need to save some firepower to support the economy if China faces “a nasty four years dealing with Donald Trump,” he said.
Beijing also wants to direct resources toward the high-tech transformation of its economy and industries. That’s another key part of the government’s 2025 agenda – and a long-term objective of Xi, who unlike US presidents is not subject to term limits on his leadership.
Beijing is pushing for innovations in AI, robotics, 6G and quantum computing, announcing astate-backed fundto support tech innovation and even welcoming foreign enterprises – in a significant tone shift for Xi – to play a role.
China is still smarting from the firstTrump administration’s campaignto keep its tech champion Huawei out of global mobile networks and from the Biden administration’s efforts to convince allies to join it incutting Chinese accessto advanced semiconductors.
Last month, Washington said it was considering expanding restrictions on US investment in sensitive technologies in China.
But Beijing this week has also touted its confidence in advancing no matter the barriers.
“Be it space science or chip making, unjustified external suppression has never stopped,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters Friday. “But where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation.”
“We are witnessing an ever-expanding horizon for China to become a science and technology powerhouse,” he said.
How much Trump’s policies will challenge China remains an open and urgent question for Beijing.
The US president has refrained so far from slapping Chinese imports with the blanket 60% or more tariffs that he had threatened on the campaign trail.
He’s been focused elsewhere, including onunleashing sweeping changesto US global leadership bydecimating US foreign assistance, threatening to take control of other countries’ sovereign territory, andupending US alliancesin Europe, whilepulling closer to Russiaat the expense of Ukraine.
There are potential risks for Beijing in that shake-up. For example, if a Washington-Moscow rapprochementpulls Xi awayfrom Russian President Vladimir Putin, his closest ally, or if an American dial-down of security in Europe allows it to ramp up attention on Asia.
But Chinese diplomats have also been taking advantage of the changes to play up their country as aresponsible and stable global leader, despite criticisms of Beijing’s ownaggressive behaviorin Asia.
“A big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in response to a question from CNN on Trump’s “America First” policy. China “resolutely opposes power politics and hegemony,” Wang added.
When it comes to tariffs, observers say Beijing is trying to moderate its response, holding out for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump or perhaps even a deal that could avert an escalating trade war.
While Chinaimmediately retaliatedagainst two sets of US tariffs this year, including with levies on US energy and key agricultural goods, it has remained measured in its reprisals.
The country’s deficit with the US means it will have less room to hit back if a trade war escalates, but Beijing is expected to be calculating other measures like export controls that it could use for leverage.
And the view from some parts is that even if tariffs cause the Chinese economy short-term pain, it will be the US which loses in the long run. China is still an indispensable part of global supply chains. It’s also better prepared to weather this trade war than the last one, because it’s sending goods to more markets globally now, data show.
“If you play (imposing tariffs) with a peer competitor, it actually would not work that well compared to if you’re doing this with small countries or medium powers,” said Zhou in Beijing, who is also the author of the forthcoming book “Should the World Fear China?”.
China, he said, wants cooperation not friction.
“But since the US is still the stronger side in this relationship, (it will) decide which kind of relationship this is … so China has to say ‘OK – if this has to be to be one of competition, then we must dare to fight,’” he said.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/21/asia/thailand-hostage-gaza-israel-celebration-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"In the crowded room, a local spiritual leader chanted verses in the Isan dialect of northeast Thailand while attendees knelt on woven mats.
Between their clasped hands ran a single white string as they performed a ceremony to welcome and protect the man who sat among them: Surasak Rumnao, who had been held hostage in Gaza for more than a year.
Dressed in a white shirt with closely cropped hair, Surasak sat beside his friend Pongsak Thaenna, who was also abducted near the Gaza border during Hamas’ deadly attack on October 7, 2023.
The two men had kept each other going throughout their 15 months in captivity; now, they smiled as family and friends took turns tying sacred white threads around their wrists to bestow blessings and ward off evil.
“I feel life is much more valuable now,” Surasak told CNN two weeks after his release, speaking at home in the northeastern Thai town of Ban Dung close to the Laos border. “(I’m) just trying to live as long as possible.”
Of the 251 people taken hostage by Hamas militants on October 7, many weremigrant workers from poor rural parts of Asia, who had gone to work in Israel’s agricultural, construction and health care sectors to send money back home. Among them were Surasak and Pongsak – two of the five Thai workersfreed in Januaryunder a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.
Like both men, many of the Thai abductees andvictimswere from Udon Thani, one of the country’s poorest provinces where jobs are hard to come by – pushing young people to overseas destinations or large cities like Bangkok for work.
At Surasak’s return party, the room was filled with elderly community members; most of their working-age children had left the small town.
After the ceremony, partygoers dug into a home-cooked feast of beef soup, fermented fish, sticky rice and minced meats, before celebrating late into the night with Thai liquors. But concerns also lingered for the remaining hostages in Gaza, including one Thai national.
“I want those who have been captured to be released quickly. We are trying to pray that they will be released, not just the Israelis but also the remaining Thai,” Surasak said.
“Having been in that situation, we understand the feeling of waiting for someone to come and help us.”
Like so many men and women from Thailand’s rural Isan region, Surasak, now 32, has been working away from home since he was a teenager – job-hunting in Bangkok after high school, then doing a stint at a factory in Taiwan.
Before the abduction, he had spent five years growing tomatoes, eggplants, figs and apples on Israeli farms.
The pay was much better than what he could earn back home, he said – to the point where he could fund his siblings’ education, give his mother money for daily spending, and support the family’s rice farm.
The impact of foreign wages is clear in Surasak’s village of Ban Dung, where new houses have popped up on dirt roads and cracked asphalt streets. His home, painted an eye-catching blue and turquoise, is one of the brightest, and has been expanded and renovated several times over the years.
But that steady flow of income and improvement came to a shuddering halt on October 7 as Hamas militants poured across the Gaza border and began their murder and kidnap spree across southern Israel.
After hearing word of the attacks, Surasak was trying to rush back to his employer’s farm when he was abducted. He and the other captured workers were tied up, put in the back of a pickup truck and told not to look around as the vehicle drove off.
The hostages were split up after they reached Gaza but Surasak and Pongsak stayed together, sleeping and eating side-by-side throughout the 15 months in captivity. Surasak said they weren’t mistreated, and were fed pita bread and cheese, with a portion of meat once a week.
Back in Ban Dung, his mother, Kammee, was anxiously contacting various Thai government agencies, who eventually confirmed that her son was one of the hostages and was still alive.
“I was afraid that he might lose weight, not eat well, or have trouble sleeping,” she told CNN. “I was scared about my child being taken away and worried about what might happen to him.”
At first, Surasak would ask his captors when he would be released – and they would assure him, “Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, in three days, next month,” he said. “After asking frequently, I stopped asking because I didn’t want to have expectations from them anymore.”
Instead, he tried to “have conversations and show them my sincerity, that I am not a soldier and have no involvement with them,” he said. He joked with his captors, even playing cards with them, using hand-drawn decks when no others were available, and sketching games of checkers.
Throughout it all, he kept track of the days by looking at the date on the guards’ wristwatches – though he had no other news about what was happening on the outside.
He and Pongsak would “encourage each other by saying that they wouldn’t do anything to us. They would release us eventually as negotiations were underway,” he said. “We trusted both the Israeli side and our Thai side, along with all the agencies that were doing their best to help us. We had to have faith in them.”
When the Hamas guards finally told Surasak in January that he would be released, he didn’t believe them, he said.
But before he knew it, they were in a car, then on a plane – then reuniting with tearful families at Bangkok airport in front of journalists and Thai officials.
Surasak’s return home was met with joy and relief, with the ceremony on Saturday meant to “call back” his spirit – a common practice after somebody has endured a hardship.
The community believes the loss of a person’s spirit or life force from their body can cause poor health or wellbeing – so on Saturday they offered gifts to entice the spirit back and restore Surasak’s happiness.
“Come back, good spirit,” the attendees chanted together. “Come back already!”
His mother said she had waited a long time for that day.
“I’m so happy and proud that my child has returned to be in our embrace once again,” she said. “My child is like the pillar of the family, and I wouldn’t just let that go. Seeing my child come back gives me so much hope, and I’m truly delighted.”
As he adjusts to being back home, Surasak says he has no plans to return to Israel. His family also wants him to stay in Thailand.
“I think I have enough. I will use the knowledge I’ve gained to improve life in our own hometown,” he said. “I want to live a life farming and cultivating the land of my ancestors.”
But his thoughts aren’t far from the remaining hostages in Gaza, and whether the ceasefire deal will hold long enough to get them all out.
In thelast round,the deal looked on shaky ground after Hamas accused Israel of violating its commitments and said it would postpone the hostage releases – though it eventually went ahead after talks with mediators in Egypt and Qatar. Six Israeli hostages are scheduled to be released next on February 22; it’s not clear when the remaining Thai hostage will be freed.
“I hope that those who are still inside remain strong. They will eventually be able to get out,” Surasak said. “Sometimes the exchanges take time… We just have to wait.”",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/business/japan-7eleven-american-ceo-intl-hnk/index.html,"Seven & I Holdings, the Japanese operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, appointed its first foreign CEO and handed him the task of overhauling its business to fend off a $47 billion overseas takeover bid and engineer a recovery.
After a tumultuous six months that began when it received a buyout offer from Canadian Circle-K operator Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT), Seven & I announced its most far-reaching leadership and business restructuring on Thursday.
Lead outside director Stephen Dacus will succeed Ryuichi Isaka as chief executive on May 27, the company said.
Addressing reporters in Japanese and English, Dacus said talks would continue with Couche-Tard, but significant regulatory hurdles stood in the way of a merger.
“What I do not think our shareholders would want is for us to spend two plus years in limbo just for that to be rejected by the US courts,” he said.
Seven & I, which has more than 80,000 7-Eleven stores in 20 countries and regions, also said it agreed to sell its superstore unit to Bain Capital for 814.7 billion yen ($5.50 billion) and that it would sell down its ownership of Seven Bank to below 40%.
Additionally, the retail conglomerate said it will buy back about 2 trillion yen ($13.5 billion) worth of shares through fiscal year 2030, and pursue a listing of its North American convenience store subsidiary by the second half of 2026.
Seven & I has been the target of investor criticism over its capital allocation for years, and in August received the ACT buyout offer that was later raised to $47 billion.
In response, a group led by Seven & I’s founding Ito family mounted its own buyout offer, while the company’s management said they could chart an independent path to recovery.
Dacus told reporters he could identify with 7-Eleven franchisees as his father had been one, and that he’d worked the midnight shift in the store as a teenager.
The incoming CEO, who previously held executive roles with Walmart and Fast Retailing, also led a special committee vetting the takeover bids. The Ito family group failed to secure a reported $58 billion in funding for its offer, scuttling the deal late last month.
Dacus was replaced as head of the special committee by another outside director, Paul Yonamine, the company said on Thursday.
Seven & I shares surged 6.1% on Thursday after Bloomberg News first reported the share buyback plan.
The buyback looked like an attempt to “try to lift market value and fend off” Couche-Tard, said Lorraine Tan, a regional director at Morningstar.
“Fundamentally, one of my immediate concerns is how they are funding the dividends and buyback,” she said. “It appears that they will have to rely on borrowings but we note the talk of a listing for its US business.”
Some analysts felt Seven & I’s restructuring plan may not derail ACT’s bid for the company.
The announced divestitures leave Seven & I mainly with its convenience store businesses at home and abroad, which is what ACT really wants, said Travis Lundy, a special situations analyst who publishes on Smartkarma.
“Because the IPO is not for a while, it would suggest there is still time for ACT to make a deal for the whole shebang, assuming they can come up with a divestment package,” he said.
Bain said separately on Thursday it plans to list the superstore unit, known as York Holdings, in about three years after scaling it up through acquisitions.
Seven & I turned the humble 7-Eleven store into a popular food destination in Japan by serving up fresh sandwiches, rice balls and rows of boxed lunches, changing how millions of people eat.
Isaka has been with the 7-Eleven operator since 1980, becoming its president in 2016. But his tenure has been criticized by foreign investors, including ValueAct Capital, which tried to oust him in 2023 for pursuing what it said was a flawed strategy.
Isaka led Seven & I’s $21 billion acquisition of Marathon Petroleum’s Speedway gas stations in 2020, outbidding ACT and greatly expanding the company’s footprint in the North American market.
But some analysts and investors said the company overpaid for the US assets while remaining saddled with low-margin subsidiaries in Japan, such as its superstore segment.
“They jumped into the global market before they had a solid foundation in place,” said independent retail analyst Akihito Nakai. “In hindsight, they got the order wrong.”
Related article7-Eleven is closing more than 400 locations
More recently, US-based Artisan Partners urged the company to consider a competitive bidding process for takeover proposals.
Isaka laid out a turnaround plan in October, aiming to roughly double sales to 30 trillion yen by 2030 by expanding overseas and focusing on fresh-food offerings.
Dacus indicated he would stick to the food-centered strategy, saying Seven & I was working with vendors to bring the products found in Japan to store shelves in the US.
“I think if we can bring that same quality of food to our stores in the US, that would be a huge and sustainable source of growth,” he said.
If ACT succeeds in winning control of Seven & I, it would be the biggest foreign takeover of a Japanese company.
Seven & I was classified as “core” to Japan’s national security in September, although the finance ministry said at the time it would not create hurdles for a takeover.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/north-korean-hackers-crypto-hack/index.html,"North Korean hackers have stolen $1.5 billion incryptocurrencyin a single heist, making it the largest crypto hack on record, security experts told CNN.
The hack hit Bybit, which describes itself as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, with over 40 million users.
In a matter of minutes on Friday, the hackers stole a significant portion of North Korea’s reported annual gross domestic product. And over the weekend, the hackers were already laundering about $160 million of the stolen loot through a series of accounts connected to North Korean operatives, according to crypto-tracing firm TRM Labs. In a single hack, the North Koreans have nearly doubled what they stole in crypto last year,the firm said.
It’s an early test for how the Trump administration will address the steep challenge of trying to prevent North Korea from funding its nuclear and missile programs through hacking.
“We’ve never seen anything on this scale before. The ability of these illicit financial networks to absorb such huge amounts of money so quickly is deeply concerning,” said Nick Carlsen, a former FBI intelligence analyst focused on North Korea who now works at TRM Labs.
North Korea’s formidable hacking corps is an essential source of revenue for the nuclear-armed, sanctions-battered dictatorship, according to current and former US and South Korean officials.
North Korean hackers have stolen billions of dollars from banks and cryptocurrency firms in the last several years, according to reports from the United Nations and private firms. About half ofNorth Korea’smissile program has been funded by such digital heists, a White House officialsaidin 2023.
Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has told users that the firm is solvent and can cover the loss of the $1.5 billion, the firm said in astatement. “Bybit worked closely with regulators and law enforcement agencies to address the hack,” the statement said.
An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no comment on the Bybit heist.
CNN has requested comment from the North Korean embassy in London.
Once a big crypto heist is carried out, North Korean operatives have to get the money back to Pyongyang. The laundering process usually involves a series of swaps through different types of digital currency, before eventually being converted to US dollars or Chinese yuan.
US and South Korean law enforcement agents monitoring the laundering process usually have mere minutes to pounce and seize some of the stolen loot. CNN previouslyreportedon one such sting operation that clawed back $1 million out of $100 million the North Koreans had allegedly stolen from a California-based cryptocurrency firm.
Investigators are currently trying to intercept some of the $1.5 billion stolen from Bybit. One group of crypto security expertssaidthey helped recover about $43 million in stolen funds so far. Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, another crypto-tracing firm, said that an additional $243,000 of the stolen money had been seized: “A drop in the ocean, but a start.”
Bybit said it would give 10% of any recovered funds to security experts who played a role in retrieving the stolen money.
Carlsen, the former FBI analyst, said the US and others need to be more aggressive in trying to intercept the North Koreans’ stolen crypto hauls.
“The current strategy from governments and industry clearly isn’t working,” Carlsen said. “People should be going back through drawing board right now on how to deter and punish North Korea for these hacks.”",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/china/china-wang-yi-press-conference-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,"If every country were to put itself first, the ‘law of the jungle’ would return, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in response to a question from CNN’s Steven Jiang about US President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy.
“There are more than 190 countries in the world,” the Chinese diplomat said during a news conference in Beijing.
“Should everyone stress ‘my country first’ and obsess over a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign again, smaller and weaker countries would bear the brunt first, and international norms and order would take a body blow,” he added.
Wang, China’s most seasoned diplomat and a trusted hand for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, made the remarks while hosting his 11th such news briefing on the sidelines of theyearly “two sessions” gatheringof China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body.
The highly choregraphed event is typically a chance for Beijing to broadcast its views on pressing global issues. But this year’s gathering, which comes as Beijing iswading into a new trade warwith Washington and Trump upends US foreign policy, gave Wang a well-timed platform to present China as a reliable leader and stable partner.
When asked about Trump’s decision todouble additional tariffs on Chinese importsto the US earlier this week, Wang struck a defiant tone: “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China on the one hand and develop good relations with China on the other.”
“This ‘two-faced’ approach is not only not conducive to the stability of bilateral relations, but also unable to establish mutual trust,” he added.

“A big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,” Wang said, adding that China “resolutely opposes power politics and hegemony.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has upended the US role on the global stage: pulling back from international pacts and bodies,cancelling much of America’s vast foreign aidand threatening totake controlof other countries’ sovereign territory. His administration has also thrown into question longstanding alliances, alienating Europe as it pivots to Russia — and earlier this weeksuspending American military aid to Ukraine.
Frequent criticisms of China’s aggression in South China Sea and its intimidation of the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan notwithstanding, Chinese diplomats have used the American president’s shakeup to inject more oomph into efforts to showcase their country — and not America — as being on the right side of history.
Few global issues have lent themselves as neatly to that rhetoric than the war in Ukraine.
Washington’s pivot toward Moscow has not only shocked European allies but left open an opportunity for Beijing to push back against longstanding criticism of its close ties with Moscow, which haveonly expanded since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking to media Wednesday on the margins of a meeting of China’s advisory body the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Lu Shaye, China’s special envoy for the European Affairs, called on countries to “first criticize the US” and not China for Russia ties.
“Is it still necessary to question whether China is favoring Russia? If they still have doubts about this, they should first criticize the US. The US is not just leaning (towards Russia) — it’s supporting it,” said Lu, a former ambassador to France who’s known for his brash style.
“European friends should reflect on how the Trump administration’s policies contrast with those of the Chinese government,” he said, adding that with its “mutually beneficial” approach to foreign policy, China’s “circle of friends will only grow.”
The Chinese foreign minister also addressed the war in Ukraine and Russia-China relations during his roughly 90-minute press conference.
Related articleUS is ‘destroying’ world order, Ukrainian ambassador warns
He hailed Moscow-Beijing ties as a “constant push in a turbulent world” at a time when Trump officials have suggested they hope to drive awedge between the two close partners.
When asked how Beijing could factor into efforts toward peace in Ukraine, which so far have appeared to be largely driven by Washington and Moscow and bypassing Europe and Ukraine, Wang reiterated China’s claim that it holds an “objective and impartial” stance on the conflict and said it “welcomes and supports all efforts for peace.”
But he also used his answer to promote a shared view between Moscow and Beijing — who have long been united in their opposition to NATO, which they have falsely blamed for sparking Russia’s invasion. `
“All parties should learn something from the crisis,” Wang said, adding in a veiled reference to the US and its Europe alliance system: “No country should build its security on the insecurity of another.”
He also indirectly criticized Washington’s approach to the conflict in Gaza, when asked about Trump’s controversial proposal last month for the US to take ownership of the war-torn enclave and redevelop it into a “Middle Eastern Riviera.”
“If the major country truly cares about the people in Gaza, it should promote comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, ramp up humanitarian assistance, observe the principle of Palestinians governing Palestine and contribute to the reconstruction,” he said.

The video also says the AI agent is more advanced than a chatbot because it doesn’t only generate ideas but delivers tangible results, such as producing a report recommending properties to buy based on specific criteria.
Alibaba touted its new model, QwQ-32B, in anonline statementas delivering “exceptional performance, almost entirely surpassing OpenAI-o1-mini and rivaling the strongest open-source reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1.” OpenAI-o1-mini is the American company’s cost-efficient reasoning model released last year.
Alibaba added the model has achieved a “qualitative leap in mathematics, coding, and general capabilities, with overall performance on par with DeepSeek R1,” it said in the statement.
The company claimed that its model has 32 billion parameters compared with DeepSeek’s R1, which has 671 billion parameters. Fewer parameters imply a model is smaller and more efficient to train.
DeepSeek stunned the world in January with its high-performing reasoning model R1 that it said cost far less to train than established Western rivals. Its success has shored up confidence among global investors in Chinese companies’ ability to innovate at the time when the US-China tech rivalry intensifies. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index hassurged over 30% since January.
Alibaba, the owner of Chinese e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, first launched its ChatGPT-equivalent service Tongyi Qianwen in 2023, after OpenAI launched its industry-defining AI reasoning model.
In January, Alibaba released another model, Qwen 2.5 Max, which it said surpassed the performance of DeepSeek’s highly acclaimed V3 model, released just a few weeks before.
Last week, Alibabapledgedto invest at least 380 billion yuan ($52.4 billion) in its AI and cloud computing infrastructure over the next three years. It said the amount exceeded what it had invested in those areas over the past decade.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/04/politics/abbey-gate-afghanistan-trump-terrorist-apprehended/index.html,"President Donald Trump announced Tuesday evening that the US has apprehended a “top terrorist” involved in the2021 bombingat Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan where 13 US service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians were killed.
Mohammad Sharifullah, who was allegedly involved in the planning of the bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, was charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support for terrorism. He arrived in the US on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the operation.
“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” Trump said in his joint address to Congress.
Pakistan acted on CIA intelligence that led to the arrest of Sharifullah, according to another source familiar with the matter. In his speech, Trump thanked Pakistan for “helping arrest this monster.”
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif returned the message of gratitude in a statement issued on Wednesday, thanking Trump for “acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan’s role and support in counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan.”
Sharif said Pakistan’s security forces apprehended Sharifullah, an Afghan national, “in a successful operation conducted in Pakistan-Afghan border region.”
“We will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,” he added.
In his speech Tuesday, Trump once again attacked President Joe Biden over the handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, a criticism he made frequently on the campaign trail last year. Trump said he spoke to the families of the service members who were killed on a call before his speech “and they did nothing but cry with happiness.”
“This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly – over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan,” Trump said. “What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown.”
Sharifullah was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, according to an indictment unsealed late Tuesday.
He was interviewed by FBI agents on Sunday, where he told them he was recruited in 2016 into ISIS-K, a branch of ISIS. In the interview, Shariffullah “admitted to supporting and conducting activities on behalf of ISIS-K in support of multiple lethal attacks,” according to the indictment.
Sharifullah, who is also known as “Jafar,” according to the court documents, was in prison from 2019 until two weeks before the Abbey Gate attack. When he was released, he was contacted by ISIS members for assistance in the attack.
“Sharifullah was tasked with scouting a route near (Hamid Karzai International Airport) HKIA for an attacker. Sharifullah conducted surveillance on a route, specifically checking for law enforcement and American or Taliban checkpoints,” the court documents state.
“Sharifullah communicated to other ISIS-K members that he believed the route was clear and that he did not think the attacker would be detected while proceeding through that route.”
ISIS members instructed him to leave the area around the airport, the court documents state. “Later that same day, Sharifullah learned of the attack at HKIA described above and recognized the alleged bomber as an ISIS-K operative he had known while incarcerated.”
The indictment also details Sharifullah’s alleged involvement in two other attacks, claiming that he conducted surveillance and transported a bomber to an attack on embassy guards in Kabul in 2016, and provided weapons training for gunmen who carried out an attack on a Moscow nightclub last year.
Sharifullah made his first federal court appearance Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia.
Magistrate Judge William Porter ordered Sharifullah to be detained until his next hearing, which is scheduled for Monday afternoon.
Sharifullah wore a powder blue uniform and a black facemask during the 10-minute hearing. A Dari language interpreter aided him during the proceedings, and he was flanked by several US marshals.
He hasn’t yet entered a plea. His public defender declined to comment about the charges after the hearing.
Trump’s CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, raised the issue during his first phone call with the Pakistani intel chief, which took place during his first few days on the job, the source familiar added.
Senior members of the administration heralded the news.
“As President Trump just announced, I can report that tonight the FBI, DOJ, and CIA have extradited one of the terrorists responsible for the murder of the 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X shortly after Trump announced the arrest. “One step closer to justice for these American heroes and their families.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/asia/australia-teen-gun-plane-boxer-int-latam/index.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A 17-year-old boy with a loaded shotgun boarded a plane at an Australian airport before being restrained by a pilot and two passengers, police said Friday.
The boy was disarmed and detained before police arrived on the scene Thursday at Avalon Airport in Victoria state.
Barry Clark, a passenger who tackled the suspect, said the boy had posed as a maintenance worker and became agitated when questioned by a flight attendant at the plane’s entrance.
“I looked up and then within a second I saw the barrel of a shotgun and I thought to myself that ain’t a tool that should be on a plane,” Clark told Network 10 television.
“When I saw the complete gun I said: we’re in trouble here,” Clark said.
“Then I saw it (move) towards her chest and so I thought, well, I’ve got to do something — this is all happening in a matter of seconds,” Clark added.
Clark, a former professional boxer and sheep shearer, said he snuck up behind the boy then pushed the gun and the flight attendant away in different directions so that she would not be hit if the gun discharged.
“I then proceeded to do what I had to do and just put him in a bit of a lock, got his hand and twisted it and put it up in his back, threw him to the floor and then put my knee in his back and held him in a position where he couldn’t get out,” Clark said.
Victoria Police Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters the boy from Ballarat in regional Victoria had climbed through a hole in the airport’s security fence before making his way to the plane’s stairs.
Reid credited Clark, the pilot and another passenger with restraining the boy.
“This would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers of that plane and Victoria Police really commend the bravery of those passengers who were able to overpower that male,” Reid said.
Sydney-bound Jetstar Airways Flight 610 was carrying about 150 people and no one was hurt, police said. The flight was cancelled.
An investigation was being carried out by crime squad detectives with no involvement from the police force’s counterterrorism unit.
The boy has been charged with multiple offenses including unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, orchestrating a bomb hoax and possessing a firearm, a police statement said. He was remanded in custody to appear in a children’s court on a date to be determined.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australian airports had robust security.
“This incident is concerning for members of the public. I commend the work of police and aviation officials in responding to it quickly,” Albanese told reporters.
Avalon Airport’s chief executive Ari Suss said his organization was working with Victoria Police in response to the emergency.
“As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we have implemented further measures across the airport, including within the terminal and surrounding areas,” Suss said in a statement.
“We continue to work closely with authorities to maintain a safe and secure environment for all travelers,” he added.
Jetstar, a budget subsidiary of Sydney-based Qantas Airways, said it was working with police and the airport to understand what happened.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/pakistan-gwadar-airport-china-intl-hnk/index.html,"With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan’s newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed byChinato the tune of $240 million, it’s anyone’s guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business.
Locatedin the coastal city of Gwadarand completed in October 2024, the airport is a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.
For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its westernXinjiangprovince with the Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.
Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there’s scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn’t connected to the national grid — electricity comes from neighboring Iran or solar panels — and there isn’t enough clean water.
An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn’t a priority for the city’s 90,000 people.
“This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,” said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specializes in Pakistan-China ties. “It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.”
Related articleThe Greek airport that was left to fall apart
CPEC has catalyzed a decades-long insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence — targeting both Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere.
Members of Pakistan’s ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by the government and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges the government denies.
Pakistan, keen to protect China’s investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.
Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. The city’s fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.
Many local residents are frazzled.
“Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,” said 76-year-old Gwadar native Khuda Bakhsh Hashim. “We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas.”
“We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from,” he added. “We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.”
Hashim recalled memories, warm like the winter sunshine, of when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn’t go to bed hungry and men found work easily, he said. There was always something to eat and no shortage of drinking water.
But Gwadar’s water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work.
The government says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it’s not clear whom they mean by “local” — Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.
Related article20 delicious reasons to visit Pakistan
Gwadar is humble but charming, the food excellent and the locals chatty and welcoming with strangers. It gets busy during public holidays, especially the beaches.
Still, there is a perception that it’s dangerous or difficult to visit — only one commercial route operates out of Gwadar’s domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, located at the other end of Pakistan’s Arabian Sea coastline.
There are no direct flights to Balochistan’s provincial capital of Quetta, hundreds of miles inland, or the national capital of Islamabad, even further north. A scenic coastal highway has few facilities.
Since the Baloch insurgency first erupted five decades ago, thousands have gone missing in the province — anyone who speaks up against exploitation or oppression can be detained, suspected of connections with armed groups, the locals say.
People are on edge; activists claim there are forced disappearances and torture, which the government denies.
Hashim wants CPEC to succeed so that locals, especially young people, find jobs, hope and purpose. But that hasn’t happened.
“When someone has something to eat, then why would he choose to go on the wrong path,” he said. “It is not a good thing to upset people.”
Militant violence declined in Balochistan after a 2014 government counterinsurgency and plateaued toward the end of that decade, according to Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Attacks picked up after 2021 and have climbed steadily since. Militant groups, especially the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, were emboldened by the Pakistani Taliban ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022.

Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area’s mountains — and their proximity to the airport — could be the ideal launchpad for an attack.
Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to the media and public.
Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, district president of the Balochistan Awami Party, said not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, “not even as a watchman.”
“Forget the other jobs, how many Baloch people are at this port that was built for CPEC,” he asked.
In December, Hoth organized daily protests over living conditions in Gwadar. The protests stopped 47 days later, once authorities pledged to meet the locals’ demands, including better access to electricity and water.
No progress has been made on implementing those demands since then.
Without local labor, goods or services, there can be no trickle-down benefit from CPEC, said international relations expert Khalid. As Chinese money came to Gwadar, so did a heavy-handed security apparatus that created barriers and deepened mistrust.
“The Pakistani government is not willing to give anything to the Baloch people, and the Baloch are not willing to take anything from the government,” said Khalid.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/nato-ukraine-survive-without-united-states-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Europe is staring down the barrel of a stark new reality where the United States being the backbone of NATO – the alliance that has guaranteed the continent’s security for almost 80 years – is no longer a given.
President Donald Trump’spublic animositytowards Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, hiswillingness to embrace Russia’s Vladimir Putinand recent comments casting doubt over whether he would defend NATO allies “if they don’t pay” have all forced European leaders to start thinking the previously unthinkable - is the US a reliable security partner at a time when the continent is being rocked by its biggest war since the 1940s?
But NATO without the US is far from impotent, with more than a million troops and modern weaponry at its disposal from the 31 other countries in the alliance. It also has the wealth and technological knowhow to defend itself without the US, analysts say.
The US and Germany are the biggest contributors to NATO’s military budget, civil budget and security investment program, at almost 16% each, followed by the UK at 11% and France at 10%, a NATO fact sheet says. Analysts say it wouldn’t take much for Europe to make up for the loss of Washington’s contribution.
If European countries unite and buy the right equipment, Europe “could pose a serious conventional and … nuclear deterrent” to Russia, Ben Schreer, Europe executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said in a Zoom call with CNN and other journalists in late February.
“Europe alone (still has) a capacity to muster the resources it would need to defend itself, it’s just a question of whether (it is) willing to,” Schreer said.
And that’s the key question. Over more than 75 years and the administrations of 14 different US presidents, including the first Trump administration, the US has been the sinew that has kept the alliance together.
Related article5 key takeaways from a frenetic weekend of Ukraine diplomacy
During the Cold War, US troops on the continent were there as a deterrent to any Soviet ambitions to expand the Warsaw Pact alliance and eventually saw out its end when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. NATO campaigns in the Balkans in the 1990s were conducted with US troops and airpower. And, until the second Trump administration took office on January 20, Washington spearheaded aid for Ukraine.
Those decades of trans-Atlantic solidarity may have come to an end in recent days, analysts say.
Trump’s Oval Office blow-up with Zelensky - after which he haltedUS aid to Kyiv- “felt like a deeper rupture, not just with Ukraine, but with the US ‘free world’ strategy from Truman through Reagan,” Dan Fried, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, said on the council’s website.
John Lough, a former NATO official who is now an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London, sees an even more profound split in the alliance.
“It simply feels that the United States sees Europe more as a competitor, a rival, than an ally,” Lough told CNN, adding that because of that the commitment for Washington to defend NATO allies is somewhat in doubt.
It’s a fracture that Lough sees as unrepairable.
“Once you start to lose part of that commitment, you effectively lose it all,” Lough said.
Some people in European circles are starting to ask whether Washington should be described “in some ways as an enemy,” he said.
But some analysts say a NATO without the US is not a bad idea.
“As soon as US allies become convinced that they can no longer trust in US capabilities to defend them when push comes to shove,they will rush to pick up the slack and work towards growing their own capabilities,” Moritz Graefrath,a postdoctoral fellow in security and foreign policy at William & Mary’s Global Research Institute, wrote in War on the Rocks last year.
“It is in this sense that — perhaps counterintuitively — a withdrawal of US forces will create an even stronger, not weaker, Europe,” Graefrath wrote.
Prime Minister of NATO member Poland, Donald Tusk, thinks this process has started already.
“Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia - we are simply stronger,” he said ahead of a European Union summit this week. “We just had to start believing in it. And today it seems to be happening.”
In concept, a European military could be formidable.
Turkey has NATO’s largest armed forces after the United States, with 355,200 active military personnel, according to the Military Balance 2025, compiled by the IISS. It’s followed by France (202,200), Germany (179,850), Poland (164,100), Italy (161,850), the United Kingdom (141,100), Greece (132,000) and Spain (122,200).
Turkey also has the most army personnel, which make up of the majority of frontline ground troops, with 260,200, France (113,800), Italy (94,000), Greece (93,000), Poland (90,600) the UK (78,800), Spain (70,200) and Germany (60,650), according to the IISS report.
In contrast, there were about 80,000 US troops assigned or deployed to bases in NATO countries as of June 2024, a July 2024 report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) says.
Most of those US troops are in Germany (35,000), Italy (12,000) and the UK (10,000), the CRS says.
Some of the larger NATO nations also have weapons equal to or many times better than what Russia has.
Take aircraft carriers for instance. While Russia has a single, antiquated aircraft carrier, the UK alone has two modern carriers capable of launching F-35B stealth fighters. France, Italy and Spain field aircraft carriers or amphibious ships capable of launching fighter jets, according to the Military Balance.
Aside from the US, France and the UK maintain nuclear forces, with both deploying ballistic missile submarines.
Related articleTrump and Zelensky’s fiery exchange underlines US pivot to Russia
The NATO allies besides the US have about 2,000 fighter and ground-attack jets among them, with dozens of new F-35 stealth jets included in that number.
Ground forces include modern tanks, including German Leopards and British Challengers, donated units of which are now serving in the Ukrainian military. European NATO countries can field powerful cruise missiles, like the jointFranco-British SCALP/Storm Shadow, which has also proven itself on the Ukrainian battlefield.
The Military Balance 2025 report notes that Europe is taking steps to improve its military forces without US help. In 2024, six European countries united in a project to develop ground-launched cruise missiles, made moves to increase munitions production capacity and to diversify their supplier base, looking to countries like Brazil, Israel and South Korea as new sources for military hardware.
Analysts say even if the US were to completely pull out of Europe, it would leave important infrastructure behind.
The US has 31 permanent bases in Europe, according to the Congressional Research Service - naval, air, ground and command-and-control facilities that would be available to the countries where they are located if the US were to leave.
And Graefrath notes, that infrastructure would not be lost to Washington if there is regret after a possible US withdrawal.
“It leaves much of the US military infrastructure intact for an extended period (ensuring) that the United States retains the ability to make a military return if Europe were to fail to respond as predicted,” he wrote.
Some hope that the talk of a US withdrawal from NATO is just Trump bluster aimed at pushing allies to cough up and spend more on defense.
They say the world, and another key US alliance, have been here before – during Trump’s first administration, when hereportedly asked the Pentagonto look at options for drawing down US troops stationed in South Korea as protection against nuclear-armed North Korea.
That came as Trump prepared for meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at which he hoped to persuade Kim to commit to giving up his nuclear arsenal.
A source close to the White House told CNN at the time that a US troop pullout was viewed as something that could possibly happen in the future but “not until long after (North Korea’s) nukes are verifiably gone.”
Related articleUS suspends offensive cyber operations against Russia, senior US official says
But Kim rejected all entreaties for him to give up his nuclear weapons program.
The Trump-Kim meeting “was sold as a big success despite that fact that it wasn’t,” said Schreer.
Afterward, the US returned to “business as usual” on the Korean Peninsula, Schreer said. The US – with tens of thousands of troops in South Korea – kept them there. Bilateral exercises with Seoul’s forces resumed, US warships visited South Korean ports and US Air Force bombers flew over the region.
The same could occur in Europe if Trump doesn’t get what he wants from Putin, analysts said. NATO could go on, with the recent threats to depart just a small bump in the road.
“If Putin tries to … screw Donald too much, even Donald Trump might recognize that,” Schreer said.",asia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/us-trade-tariffs-trump-fact-check/index.html,"President Donald Trump hasfor yearswildly exaggerated the size of US trade deficits with various other countries. Now, as Trump cites those trade deficits as a key justification for his tariff policies,newly released federal statisticsshow just how wrong Trump’s numbers are.
Previously released federal figures for 2023 and part of 2024 had already shown that Trump’s claims about the US deficits with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union were way off. Now, the Department of Commerce has published full-year 2024 figures that allow us to say precisely how far off.
The figures were released Thursday, hours before Trump announced a pause, until April 2, on his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican productscovered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreementhe signed in his first term.
Before we get into the data, a quick reminder: Having a trade deficit with another country means the US imports more goods and services from the country than the US exports. Though Trump often describes trade deficits as subsidies or losses, having a deficitdoes not meanthe US is giving away money for nothing.
For example, the US trade deficit with Canada exists largely because the US imports alarge quantity of cheap Canadian heavy crude oilthat helps keep gas prices down for American drivers.
Trump, who on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on almost all imports from Canada (10% on energy), has repeatedlysaidthis year that the US has a “$200 billion” trade deficit with Canada – sometimes making the claimexplicitlyand sometimes using vaguer language about a supposed $200 billionsubsidyorlossto Canada.
Trump’s number is not even close to correct. The new federal statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion, down from $40.6 billion in 2023.
Even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the 2024 deficit with Canada was $70.6 billion. It was $72.3 billion in 2023.
Trump also imposed 25% tariffs on products imported from Mexico. Hesaidin a Fox News interview in February, “We have a deficit with Mexico of $350 billion.”
Again, that’s distant from reality. The new federal figures show the 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods and services trade was $179 billion, up from $162.1 billion in 2023.
The 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods trade alone was $181.5 billion, up from $161.4 billion in 2023.
Trump, who has imposed aseries of tariffsin his first and second presidential terms on products imported from China,saidin a Fox News Radio interview in February that “we have a deficit with China of over $1 trillion.” He repeated the “$1 trillion” number in a Februaryspeech.
That, too, is a massive exaggeration. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That’s up from $252.1 billion in 2023 – but lower than ineveryyearof Trump’s first presidency.
Trade deficits rise and fall fornumerous reasonsother than presidential policy. We mention the fact that Biden-era deficits were lower than Trump-era deficits, though, because Trump hasclaimedthat Biden let the deficit with China “get out of hand.”
The 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion, up from $278.7 billion in 2023.
Trump has regularly, andincorrectly, castigated the European Union over its trade practices. Hetold reportersin February that “with the European Union, it’s, you know, $350 billion deficit.” Hesaidat a subsequent February event that it’s “about a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.”
Wrong once more. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods and services trade was $161.1 billion, up from $125.1 billion in 2023.
The 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods trade alone was $236.7 billion, up from $201.6 billion in 2023. So, counting only goods trade, Trump’s claims about the deficit with the European Union are a bit closer to the truth than his claims about the deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China – but they’re still not actually close to the truth.

Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump has fundamentally changed transatlantic relations, suspendedall military aidand intelligence sharing to Kyiv and again cast doubt that the US would defend its NATO allies if attacked.
With Russia posing what French President Emmanual Macron called an “existential threat” to Europe, the continent is now scrambling to prepare for theonce-unthinkable prospectof defending itself in a potential future conflict without the help of America.

Here’s what to know:
At an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Brussels, the EU leaders agreed to plans that could free up billions of euros to ensure Europe’s security, boost defense spending, and shore up support for Kyiv.
The EU’s executive arm presented leaders with a proposal that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($862 billion) to bolster defense on the continent.
Part of the rearmament plan would provide countries with loans totaling up to 150 billion euros ($162 billion).

European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen called it a “watershed moment” for Europe and said detailed legal proposals will be studied ahead of another meeting at the end of the month.
A senior EU official told CNN they expect the bloc’s leaders to give a green light allowing the defense plan to be moved “forward very swiftly.”
Macron also announced the EU will give Ukraine more than $33 billion in assistance, taken from Russians sanctioned by Europe. “In 2025, the EU will provide Ukraine with 30.6 billion euros, financed by Russian assets,” Macron said.
The leaders said that Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine constituted an “existential challenge for the European Union,” and that Europe must become “more sovereign, more responsible for its own defense and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats.”
A joint declaration from the NATO leaders’ summit in Washinton, DC last year, stated that “Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to NATO security.” In the eyes of his allies, Trump is throwing that central theme to the wind.
On Thursday, Trump again suggested theUS may abandon its commitmentsto the security alliance – a key bedrock of Western security against the risk of a Russian attack – saying that member countries were not spending enough on defense.
“I think it’s common sense. If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump said.
At the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty is the promise of collective defense — that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all.
Trump has long complained about the amount NATO members spend on defense compared with the US.
But his comments could raise alarm around the world, coming as the US changes its position on the Ukraine war, and amid accusations the Trump administration isaligning with Russiaover its allies.
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” Kyiv’s ambassador to the United Kingdom Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Thursday. He added that the US is “destroying” the current world order.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Thursday emphasized the importance of the US’ commitment to NATO, saying, “Let me be clear, the Transatlantic relationship and the Transatlantic partnership remains the bedrock of our Alliance.”
As European leaders voiced near-unanimous support for Ukraine, European Commission President Von der Leyen warned that negotiations for peace would only be possible with Europe’s support.
Of the 27 EU leaders present in Brussels, all but one signed a text calling for a peace deal that respects “Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while including Ukraine in the negotiations. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban abstained.
France’s Macron had outlined a plan for a one-month “air, sea and energy infrastructure” ceasefire in Ukraine, which could pave the way for a more lasting peace deal.
But he warned that allies “must avoid a ceasefire that is discussed in haste.”
And Ukraine withdrawing its NATO bid without a security guarantee as a condition of any ceasefire is “obviously unacceptable,” he added.
Zelensky said he is “preparing practical proposals” to end the war with European leaders. The first step would be for Russia to stop airstrikes on energy and civilian infrastructure and halt “all military operations in the Black Sea,” Zelensky posted on X.

The Ukrainian president will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia next week, and his team will stay in the country “to work with our American partners,” he said.
The UK and Turkey, two NATO allies and key backers of Ukraine – but not EU members – were not present at the summit. Britain’s leader Keir Starmer has said he is ready to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help keep any truce agreed between Kyiv and Moscow.
Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, rejected the one-month ceasefire proposal, and said the idea of European peacekeeping troops being deployed in Ukraine would be “unacceptable.”
The ministry said the “normalization” of the Russia-US relationship is “causing panic” in Europe.
Meanwhile, China’s special envoy for European Affairs Lu Shaye said he hopes Europe can be stirred by the “Trump administration’s aggressive and domineering policies toward Europe” to “at least reflect on some of their past policies toward China.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/style/ukraine-art-artifacts-russia-war-cec/index.html,"For Ukrainians, more than three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion, the war isn’t just being fought in the trenches. It’s in the museums, and in the cultural heritage they seek to preserve.
Amid the continuing onslaught, the country’s historical centers — which, one could argue, hold the cultural identity of Ukraine — have struggled. Heritage sites have been damaged; museums have been looted; artifacts have been stolen. And these catastrophesaren’t random— legal experts and historians claim Russia intentionally targets artistic and cultural sites as a way to eradicate Ukrainian identity.
“Even if we have an advantage on the battlefield, but they destroy all our museums, burn all our books, will we be able to remain Ukrainian?” asked Halyna Chyzhyk, a legal expert working to protect Ukraine’s remaining cultural sites. “What will we have left?”
Politically, Ukraine has also seen its largest ally, the US, see-saw from backing its cause to diplomaticallyaligning with Russia, as US President Donald Trump attempts torush a peace deal. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its offensive, launching its largest drone attack of the last three years on the eve of the war’s anniversary.
Still, Ukrainian art historians and museum directors are doing everything they can to retrieve stolen works and protect what remains.
As of January, UNESCO has verified damage to476 cultural properties— ranging from cathedrals to museums, monuments and libraries. The Ukrainian Heritage Monitoring Lab puts the toll higher, telling CNN that in its 128 expeditions it has “reliably documented more than 1,200 damaged cultural heritage sites and cultural infrastructure” across the country. As Chyzhyk, and countless cultural industry expertshave said, many sites have been directly targeted and destroyed by Russian forces, not just collateral damage.
As the war grinds on, historians and museum workers have begun taking evacuation measures into their own hands.
Historian Leonid Marushchak, co-founder of NGO Museum Open for Renovation, has evacuated almost 2 million artifacts — paintings, sculptures and so on — as Russian forces continue to target and desolate museumsaround the country.
Among the evacuated exhibits was a stone sculpture of a lion, which may be up to 1,000 years old. It was stored at a museum in Bakhmut, a town captured by Russians after heavy fighting thatlasted for more than six months.
“I couldn’t sleep because of this lion,” Marushchak said. “When the city was almost destroyed and even museum walls were falling down, we went there to get that lion out.”
For many historians and museums, documenting the destruction is a significant part of the restoration process. Crimes have to be recorded while there are still traces of them, said Vasyl Rozhko, founder of the Ukrainian Heritage Monitoring Lab.
As an example, he used a church built in the 1860s in the northern village of Vyazivka, which sustained some damage in the attacks in 2022and collapsed less than a year later. The team made a 3D model of the church, and later a laser scan. But while deciding how exactly to save the structure, the church collapsed. The only thing left was that 3D model, Rozhko said.
“Some objects can stand (after damage) but some cannot,” he added. “And if we don’t document and record them, we won’t even know what to save.”
For others, preservation looks a little different. At the Khanenko Museum in Kyiv, one of the biggest art museums in the country, director Yulia Vaganova and her team have determined that the only way to save the collection — comprised primarily of art from other Western European countries, not Ukraine — is to show it.
Sometimes, that means transferring the artwork to other museums in Europe. In 2023, for protection, Vaganova transferred 16 worksto the Louvre, which briefly showcased five of them as an exhibit. At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, 37 works from the Khanenko are also on display.
“In the museum, we asked ourselves: What should we do? And who are we as a museum? What is our work during the war? And if we were just a storage facility, we would probably just have to close down,” Vaganova said. “But a museum is always broader than just preserving works.”
Still, showcasing an exhibit is different now than before the invasion. Every two weeks, curators select one small item from the collection and show it for one day, before packing it up and moving it back to safety. For a museum housing 25,000 works, presenting just a single item is a downsize. But it also gives the curators a chance to highlight something that may have gone overlooked before the invasion. And the audience has responded.
“You can see how much people miss the collection. You can see how longingly and sometimes tenderly they appreciate that the museum is open, that they can come here,” Vaganova said. “There is a lot of support, warmth and tenderness in this, but also fragility.”
At any point, she explains, the museum can be targeted. Their collections are vulnerable, and the team may not be able to secure everything. Even for a museum of mostly international works, its existence is part of Ukrainian heritage, Vaganova said.
Other museum bosses are still on a mission to retrieve tens of thousands of artifacts stolen early on in the full-scale invasion.
A few months before February 24, 2022, founder of the Kherson Art Museum Alina Dotsenko and her team happened to have packed away the site’s entire collection, to prepare for restoration work on the building.
But seven months later, inOctober 2022, a different kind of invasion occurred. Groups of museum workers from Russian-occupied Crimea found out about the hidden collection and loaded about 10,000 of the museum’s artifacts and works into trucks and drove them away.
Weeks later, after Kherson was liberated by the Ukrainian army, Dotsenko visited the once-full and methodized storage facilities. There were only empty racks left.
“I’m not touchy,” Dotsenko says, recalling the moment from years prior. “But I just slid down the wall, sat on the floor in the empty storage rooms, and just cried.”
Just like that, the Kherson museum’s once robust collection dwindled to just about 3,000 artifacts.
Dotsenko tracked down some of the works thanks to pictures from a journalist showing the same trucks unloading at a museum in Crimea. When Dotsenko and her team claimed theft, the Crimean museum said it was “trying to preserve the collection,” Dotsenko said.
Dotsenko still has the documents detailing the Kherson museum’s stock. Those records have allowed her and her team to uncover exactly what and how much was taken. They’ve hidden the remaining collection and helped open criminal cases for the rest, she said, but there’s little else she can do.
“We are working for this every day,” Dotsenko said. “And I don’t know how it will end.”
Such retrieval attempts aren’t just a way to preserve valuable history. In some ways, the aim is to preserve Ukraine itself.
In 2022, the historic home of Hryhorii Skovoroda — a famous Ukrainian poet and philosopher — was destroyed in a missile strike, along with the museum of his work. The home, located in a tiny village and not nearby any obvious military targets, has been considered an act ofcultural vandalism.
Recalling that attack, Chyzhyk said these offenses are of “great symbolic importance.” The goal doesn’t seem to be any particular monument or structure, she said. Instead, the goal is seemingly destroying as many historical and cultural artifacts as possible, even the ones that only matter to small communities. Even if they can’t kill the people, Chyzhyk said, they can kill the very things that make them Ukrainian.
However, fully protecting any of the artwork is impossible, said Vaganova. You can’t just move a museum from the east, which borders Russia, to the west. There aren’t huge storage facilities; no bunkers with doors big enough for thousands of priceless art to be contained. Wherever you store the art, she said, it could still be bombed.
Even if a museum diligently evacuates its work, there can still be damage, added Rozhko. Some of them aren’t packed well or accounted for; there can also be deterioration.
“Often, such evacuation can be even more harmful than being in the occupied territory,” he said.
In short: There’s no correct answer; no handbook dictating the exact right way to preserve an entire country’s cultural history. If you hide the works, like Dotsenko, they can be found and stolen. If you evacuate them, they can be damaged. If you leave them, they could be destroyed.
“There is no right solution to this case at all. It simply does not exist,” said Vaganova. “And this is, of course, the nightmare of every museum director.”",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/europe/ukraine-europe-summit-eu-trump-zelensky-intl-latam/index.html,"European leaders agreed to significantly boost defense spending to ensure Europe’s security and voiced near-unanimous support for Ukraine at an extraordinary meeting on Thursday, after the United States dramatically pulled back its assistance to the continent in a historic upending of transatlantic relations.
At the summit in Brussels, 26 European leaders signed a text calling for a peace deal that respects “Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” while including Ukraine in the negotiations. Hungary abstained.
In a separate text, all 27 leaders of Europe greenlit proposals that could free up billions of euros to boost defense spending, calling on the European Commission to find new ways to “facilitate significant defense spending at national level in all Member States.”
Leaders noted a proposal from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that would provide countries with loans totaling up to 150 billion euros ($162 billion) and said the plan would be studied ahead of another meeting at the end of the month.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky attended Thursday’s special session, and thanked the leaders of the European Union (EU) for supporting him as his relationship with US President Donald Trump disintegrated over recent days.
“During all (of) this period, and last week, you stayed with us,” Zelensky said at the meeting. “From all the Ukrainians, from all our nation: big appreciation. We are very thankful that we are not alone.”
Following the Special European Council summit in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Thursday that the EU will give Ukraine over $33 billion in assistance, taken from Russians sanctioned by the EU.
“The priority is to support Ukraine and its army in the very short term,” Macron said. “In 2025, the EU will provide Ukraine with 30.6 billion euros, financed by Russian assets.”
In Washington meanwhile, Trump reiterated his criticism of unequal defense spending among NATO countries.  “I think it’s common sense. If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump said.
Heads of the 27 EU nations had traveled to Brussels to find a path forward in the conflict; the latest in a string of sessions aimed at finding a ceasefire deal with Ukraine’s support before the US and Russia force one on Kyiv. But some fear that the involvement of ambivalent countries could derail efforts to put together a peace plan which might satisfy bothKyiv and Washington.And there is uncertainty across Europe that Trump would even be interested in any plan the continent presents him with.
Asked about how Europe can convince the US to include them in negotiations over the war in Ukraine, von der Leyen said that all parties want “peace from a position of strength.”
“This is also in the interest of President Trump, to have a peaceful strength, and if he wants to achieve this, it is only possible with the support of the European Union and its member states, because pre-conditions have to be met,” she said.
Europe is “entering a new era,” Macron admitted in a televised address on Wednesday night, describing an increased weariness over the shift in Trump’s tone toward Moscow.
“The United States, our ally, has changed its position on this war, is less supportive of Ukraine and is casting doubt on what will happen next,” Macron warned.
And Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who wasdismissedas Ukraine’s military chief last year in a major shakeup before becoming Kyiv’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, said in unusually blunt andpotentially incendiary remarksthat the US is “destroying” the current world order.
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” he said at London think tank Chatham House on Thursday. “It’s not just the ‘axis of evil’ and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order.”
Hungary was the only country whose leader refused to sign Thursday’s Ukraine text at the summit, though Prime Minister Viktor Orban did agree to the statement on defense. By doing so, Hungary “isolated” itself from the consensus of Europe, European Council President Antonio Costa said in a statement to press after the meeting.
Thursday was the third hastily organized European meeting over the future of the war since the Trump administration dramatically pulled back its support for the continent.
A Sunday summit in London saw some progress: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said a small group of European nations would work with Zelensky on a ceasefire proposal, then present it to the US – a workaround that might avert another meltdown in relations between Trump and Zelensky.
But this meeting had a key difference: It involves every nation in the bloc, not just the countries who opted to attend Starmer’s summit. And some countries are neither willing nor interested in supporting Ukraine’s fight for survival.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly resisted calls to support Kyiv militarily. Unlike most of his European counterparts, he supported Trump following the president’s argument with Zelensky, writing on X: “Strong men make peace, weak men make war.”
The Ukrainian leader said on Telegram Wednesday that Kyiv and Europe “are preparing a plan for the first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon.”
As talks gather to talk peace, Russia continues assaulting Ukraine on daily basis.
Zelensky arrived to Brussels just hours after the latest wave of Russian drone and missile attacks targeted his home town of Kryvyi Rih. A strike against a hotel in the southeastern city killed four people and injured many more, the president said early Thursday, adding that foreign citizens including Americans and Britons were among those staying at the hotel.
A senior EU diplomat told CNN that discussions around burden sharing are likely to feature heavily in Thursday’s summit, stressing that the burden for Ukraine’s aid needs to be “shared more evenly” between member states.
Reaching an agreement on that will prove difficult. Without singling any countries out, the diplomat highlighted how the countries that aren’t paying their “fair share” when it comes to Ukraine are also usually failing to spend over 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.
Some serious progress is nonetheless expected. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan to rearm Europe in the build-up to the summit, and said the bloc could mobilize funds up to 800 billion euros ($862 billion) to achieve it. “We are in an era of rearmament,” she said in a statement Wednesday.
“The question is no longer whether Europe’s security is threatened in a very real way,” she added. “Or whether Europe should shoulder more of the responsibility for its own security. In truth, we have long known the answers to those questions.”
A senior EU official told CNN that they expect EU leaders to give a green light allowing von der Leyen’s defense plan to be moved “forward very swiftly.”
There are immediate discussions taking place too: including on what the peacekeeping force deployed to Ukraine to uphold a potential ceasefire might look like. First proposed just two weeks ago, the force has quickly morphed from an idea to an apparent condition of any deal.
The UK, France and Turkey would likely contribute the bulk of any such force, a European official familiar with the negotiations told CNN in the build-up to the summit.
But the official said Eastern European states that neighbor Russia were concerned that contributing to the force might leave their own borders vulnerable – a fear that Poland has been particularly open about since it was first raised.
“European NATO has about 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) of eastern border, so you don’t want to empty the eastern border,” the official said. “Most likely the boots on the ground, if there is to be such a component, will not come from countries like Finland or Poland who are frontline countries already and need to keep the boots on their own ground.”
The official said it was a “reasonable assumption” that most of the troops would come from Britain, France and Turkey.
The official said a timeline for confidence-building measures was under discussion, but said it might prove “challenging” for a limited ceasefire in Ukraine and prisoner swaps to begin by Easter. Agreeing and implementing a full-blown ceasefire across the whole front line in that timeframe would be “completely unrealistic,” they added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/europe/pope-vatican-hospitalization-anxiety-intl/index.html,"The Apostolic Palace in the Vatican is home to the Holy See’s Secretariat of State, the engine room of the Catholic Church’s central administration. Entering the offices on the third floor of the Renaissance palazzo, you walk past frescoes of some of the first maps of the world, a reminder that the church had a global vision and influence long before globalization came into fashion.
Now, with Pope Francisentering his fourth weekin hospital, those working in the Apostolic Palace are grappling with the continuing uncertainty over the pope’s health. The same is true for everyone working in the Vatican.
The two highest-ranking secretariat officials are Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See’s Secretary of State, and Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra, the “sostituto,” or “substitute,” who acts as a papal chief of staff. They have seen Francis in hospital on at least two occasions. During normal times, they would individually have a scheduled weekly audience with the pope and remain in regular contact with him.
Parolin, a mild mannered, thoughtful prelate, is an experienced diplomat from northern Italy who leads engagement in geopolitics and has been instrumental inbrokering the Holy See’s agreement with China. Some talk about him as a future pope and it was Parolin who led the first of the daily prayer sessions for Francis’ health in St. Peter’s Square.
Peña Parra, a church diplomat from Venezuela, coordinates the work of the Roman Curia, the church’s central administration. A decisive and resilient character, he underwent a fierce cross-examination last summer in London ina landmark legal casebrought against the Vatican over a real estate deal dispute. The judge sided with the Vatican – and Peña Parra – on the key points.
It is these two officials who oversee much of the day-to-day church government as Francis remains hospitalized. The Roman Curia is made up of different departments – known as dicasteries – located in offices in and around Vatican City State and Rome. The departments, such as those for appointing bishops, continue to hold meetings and carry out their day-to-day tasks.
While the work continues, it does so at a slower pace. Heads of state coming to Rome to meet the pope stay away, as do groups of bishops travelling to the Eternal City. Major events which rely on the convening power of the papacy are put on hold. The prevailing mood in the Vatican is anxiety and a sense of uncertainty.

“It’s always difficult when the head, for whatever reason, disappears because the Holy Father is a very hands-on person with regards to management of the curia and of his interest in the work of all the dicasteries,” Cardinal Arthur Roche, the leader of the Vatican department for liturgy, told CNN.
“(We are) very used to him suddenly ringing for an opinion or to share some observation that he’s made. So, in that sense, things have gone very quiet.”
The cardinal, who is from the United Kingdom, explained that “the work goes on” even though it is an “uncertain period” with raised levels of anxiety.
“But we are hopeful that the good Lord will help him along and restore his health,” he added. “And if not, we can at least back him up by our prayers in sustaining his health at a moment when he needs our support. He’s always willing… to help us and it’s a wonderful opportunity for us to help him when he’s in need.”
The 88-year-old pope is still signaling that he’s governing the church from the hospital. Even as he battles pneumonia in both lungs, Francis is signing off documents “from the Gemelli hospital,” appointing bishops and aNASA scientist as a member of the Pontifical Academy for Sciencesand calling the Catholic parish in Gaza.
It is also the pope himself who asked the doctors and the Vatican communication apparatus to provide thedetailed daily bulletinson his health. And, on Thursday night, people heard the pope’s voice for the first time since his hospitalization. In what must have taken a big effort, Francis, struggling to get his words out after weeks of respiratory issues, thanked the people in St. Peter’s Square for their prayers.
Each night cardinals and senior Vatican officials gather in St. Peter’s Square to pray for Francis. The mood has been quiet and somber. Anthony Ekpo, a Vatican official and author of “The Roman Curia: History, Theology, and Organization,” said that the curia’s job had become focused on “prayerful support for the pope” along with “continuing the task of assisting him in the work of governing the Universal Church.”
The pope’s hospitalization has changed the tenor of the Catholic Church’s jubilee year, a once-in-every-25-years event focused on pilgrimage and forgiveness. A jam-packed schedule of events with the pope had been planned, but in Francis’ absence, senior cardinals have been tasked with leading the celebrations.
Related articleWould Pope Francis resign? Experts say it’s unlikely – but the pontiff often springs surprises
All of this is creating a pre-conclave atmosphere. Vatican observers watch to see how each cardinal deputizing for the pope acts, and whether they arepapabile(literally “pope-able,” or a potential candidate to be pope).
Interest in papal elections has become intensified by the popularity of the movie “Conclave,”which several senior church figures have watched.
Francis, who despite physical difficulties has always remained mentally alert, has ensured no figure exercises outsize influence in his absence.
He has two personal secretaries, both priests, assisting him up at the hospital but they remain out of the public eye. Throughout his pontificate, he has rotated secretaries, refused a personal spokesman and never allowed a figure to emerge as “deputy.”
In contrast, John Paul II’s long periods of ill-health and hospitalization created a power vacuum in Rome. As his health faltered, top officials in the Vatican took control of key decisions with his private secretary, now Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, becoming a powerful gatekeeper. A similar role was carried out for Benedict XVI by Archbishop Georg Gänswein.
No one knows how long Francis will remain in hospital and the prognosis of his complex condition remains “reserved,” according to Vatican sources.
Friends of the pope say he is determined to get out of hospital and return to the Casa Santa Marta, his residence since the 2013 conclave. The Santa Marta is also where the cardinals stay during a conclave. Francis’ recovery could take many weeks, and the prospect he might resign has been speculated upon.
From March 9 to 14, the leaders of the Roman Curia will embark on spiritual exercises for the season of Lent, which this year focuses on “the hope of eternal life.” During this period, believers seek to spiritually follow Christ into the wilderness of the desert for a time of prayer, fasting and almsgiving in preparation for Easter.
For the Vatican, the Lent of 2025 takes place in a desert of uncertainty as the pope’s health hangs in the balance. They are hoping – and praying – that a way ahead emerges.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/janice-deerwester-american-woman-moved-france-age-70/index.html,"She’d dreamed of living in France for years, but according to Janice Deerwester, originally from Texas, life always seemed to get in the way.
In 2021, Janice, who has been a widow since 2012, found herself lying on her bed with the lyrics to “Is That All There Is?,” a song about dissatisfaction that was a hit for singer Peggy Lee back in 1969, playing in her head.
“I hated that song when it came out, but all of a sudden it came to my mind,” Janice, who was based in Georgia at the time, tells CNN Travel. “I thought, ‘Is this all there is?’ I work, come home tired. I get up. Is this it?”
Realizing that she wanted more from life, Janice decided there and then that she would relocate to Fontainebleau — the French town she’d had her heart set on since a 2018 visit. Less than a year later, at the age of 70, she did just that.
“I’m very impulsive so that kind of followed the rule,” she adds.
Now happily settled in Fontainebleau, located southeast of Paris, Janice feels that she “made the best choice ever” and is incredibly grateful to be living out her fantasy.
“I am the luckiest woman I feel that ever was,” she says. ”And why I have this, and why I was given this, I have no idea. But I’m just blessed every day that I get to live here.”
Janice goes on to explain that she wasn’t necessarily unhappy back in Georgia, and enjoyed living on a horse ranch in the country, which she had been renting since selling her home, but was overcome with the feeling that “there’s got to be more” to life.

Despite being retired, she was working two jobs to fill her time and worried that she’d get to “that home” one day and ask, “Why in the heck did you not go to France?”
Once she’d made the decision to relocate, Janice called her daughter, Jennifer, who was in her early 20s at the time, to tell her the news.
Although Jennifer was initially hesitant of the idea, Janice says she was eventually very supportive.
“She said, ‘You’ve done everything for me,’” Janice recounts. “’Go do what you want to go do.’ I said, ‘Hey, that sounds good to me.’ So that’s what I did.”
While Janice had initially envisioned living in an apartment with a spiral staircase, she soon realized that this wouldn’t be possible as she had a procedure on her knee in 2021.
“I needed an elevator,” she adds, explaining that she settled on a simpler apartment that she’d originally viewed back in 2018.
Janice then sold her car and got rid of as much of her stuff as she could, putting some things into storage for her daughter.
“If she wanted the china, she could have it,” she says. “If she wanted the silverware and all that kind of stuff. She could have it. If not, she can sell it. I don’t care.”
According to Janice, a lot of her clothes “went out the door” when she began looking into the way French women dressed and realized that” they don’t walk down the street in leggings.”
Janice also applied for a visitor’s visa, which would permit her to remain in France for between three to 12 months. In February 2022, she left the US, bringing along her elderly dog Buster and her cat Kitty.
“I had three suitcases, and honestly, one was almost all shoes,” she says.
Her daughter came with her, as “you can’t bring two animals yourself,” and they flew from Atlanta to New York and then New York to Paris.
“I thought it’d be easier on the animals,” she adds. “It was more traumatic for me, and they were just fine.”
Janice admits she struggled during her first few days in France, and began to wonder whether she’d made a big mistake.

“I just broke down and started crying,” she recalls. “And I said, ‘I miss my yellow tennis shoes…’ Of course, that’s a euphemism. I just don’t know if I belong here or not.”
Janice says that her mood started to improve after she had a good night’s sleep and did some furniture shopping. But it took a while for her to feel settled.
Looking back on those initial few months in France, Janice admits that she found simple things like going to the grocery store highly stressful.
“I’ve never been shy, but I was always afraid when I checked out that I wasn’t going to have the money, or the card wouldn’t work or something,” she admits.
“And I would be embarrassed, and they would say, ‘Well, stupid Americans.’ And I did that for almost a year. I stressed out when I went to the store.”
As time went on, Janice began to feel more and more comfortable and built a strong network of friends in France.
On the advice of one of her friends, she launched a YouTube channel,Janice in France,which now has nearly 30,000 subscribers, chronicling her adventures in the European country.
“I enjoy it very much…” she says. “It gives me a purpose.”
Janice, who has a master’s degree in counseling, also facilitates a group focused on topics such as aging, being separated from families and grief.
“I know what it’s like to have no one to talk to,” she adds, explaining that she also spends a lot of time working with her church, and has hosted Christmas parties at her home for those who are alone during the festive season.
“We need to give back,” she says. “I try to give back in my community. I try to give back at the church. If someone is sick, I try to help.
“We just need to give back. We need to have a purpose in life. I just can’t get up in the morning and play with the dog and turn on the iPad and watch YouTube all day.
“There has to be more in life. So, YouTube has given me that (purpose). But if I didn’t have it, I probably would know French better.”
While she takes language lessons, Janice admits that her French hasn’t improved much during the three years that she’s been living in the European country.
She explains that she doesn’t always get a chance to speak the language, as the locals she knows are often keen to practice their English with her.

“Of course, my French in the southern accent is horrible anyway,” she jokes, noting that she’s able to get by and “can pretty much read signs to tell me if I’m about to fall in a ditch.”
“I’m still trying to learn the language, but I live in a beautiful town where the people are so very kind to me.”
In fact, one of the things Janice loves most about living in Fontainebleau is the kindness of the people.
“I can get on the train, and if it’s crowded, I guess because I’m older — I don’t think I’m older, but they think I’m older I guess — they get up and give me their seat…” she says, adding that the same thing happens when she rides the bus “when it’s raining” or “too darn cold.”
“It’s just like, wow,” she says. “People are so kind.”
Janice points out that Fontainebleau’s close proximity to Paris, which is around an hour away by train, was a major selling point for her on deciding to move there.
She travels to the French capital regularly “for a cup of coffee “ with friends, and is looking forward to an upcoming trip to see the 1964 musical “Hello, Dolly.”
“I love going into Paris…” she says. “But I love my little town.”
According to Janice, one of the best things about living in France is the huge focus on family.
“The US is all about the dollar, the almighty dollar,” she says. “France is about family. Time off with their family. Holidays with the family.
“On Monday in my town, and most towns except for Paris, of course. All the banks are closed.”
However, adapting to life over there hasn’t been without its challenges.
For Janice, the much-complained-about French bureaucracy is high on the list.
“Bureaucracy is difficult. But also I can’t just pick up the phone and call them,” she notes, before adding that she’s still waiting for her long-stay visa to come through.
“But, you know, it gets done. I have had people that have called me and said, ‘Janice, I think I want to move there and I want to get a hold of a realtor… and she hasn’t got back to me in two days.’ And I said, ‘Well, she’s probably with her family.”
She notes that if you call a realtor in the US, “they’ll call you back in about an hour and a half to two hours,” but things are very different in France.
“Here it may be two or three days, because you are not priority,” she says. Their family is priority… and what’s going on in their life.”
While she says she doesn’t ever really get lonely, Janice admits that there have been moments where she’s felt “despondent.”
She recalls paying a visit to the Fontainebleau Palace and people watching during a day when she was feeling particularly low.
“I just watched everybody and looked, went and had a hot chocolate and sat there and thought, ‘Okay, I’m done. I’m going home now,’” she says.
“Because I am one that really doesn’t get lonely. I live alone, but I’m not alone.”
She says she recently turned down a marriage proposal “from a young man” who “wanted me to come live with him because we’re getting older and all that.”
“I said, ‘No, no, I’m fine. Thank you,’” she adds.
After three years in France, Janice, now 73, has no plans to return to the US permanently, and believes that she’s “the best person for me” right where she is.
“I couldn’t even imagine moving back to Georgia,” she says. “I mean, ‘Janice in Georgia.’ No. What would I do there?”
She has another dog, Max — Buster passed away last year — and loves the freedom of being able to pretty much do what she wants, when she wants.
While she misses her daughter, as well as Mexican food, Janice says that they talk regularly and Jennifer enjoys coming over to France to visit. Janice’s last trip to the US was two years ago.
“I have to go back in September,” she says, adding that if she had a choice in the matter, she wouldn’t be returning at all.
She points out that she’s already seen much of the US, and is ready for new adventures.
Janice hopes her story will inspire older people to “just live life to the fullest” in whatever way that might mean for them, so that they “don’t end up in a nursing home and go, ‘darn, I wish I had done that.’”
Or perhaps find themselves wondering “is that all there is?”
“Do it now,” she says, stressing that “It doesn’t have to be France.”
“It could be maybe I want to move closer to my kids, or maybe I want to move away from my kids…
“Or maybe I want to take maybe two or three months out of the year… I want to travel.
“People, they get older, I think they get so comfortable where they are that they don’t want to step out of that little safe zone.
“And, man, once you step out of it, it’s so great. It’s awesome.”",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/sport/harry-kane-alisson-bayern-liverpool-champions-league-spt/index.html,"Harry Kaneset numerous British records as he scored twice to help Bayern Munich beat its German rival,Bayer Leverkusen, 3-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday.
The English striker scored a goal in both halves at the Allianz Arena as Bayern took control of the tie, moving one step closer to the quarterfinals.
Kane opened the scoring with a close-range header in the ninth minute, converting Michael Olise’s cross to give the home side the perfect early start.
And after Jamal Musiala had doubled Bayern’s lead shortly after half-time when he capitalized on a mistake from Leverkusen goalkeeper Matěj Kovář, Kane’s second goal of the game came from the penalty spot with 15 minutes remaining to clinch an impressive win.
“I think we felt the hype around the game,” Kanetold TNT Sportsafterwards. “We knew that we were here at the Allianz. There was a lot of talk after the last performance away from home, but there were a lot of different factors that went into the game.
“We were fresh. We’ve come off playing on Friday night. We had a good time to prepare. Everyone was ready to go out there and have a high intensity, especially without the ball.
“That’s where the game was won really today; tidying up on the second balls, controlling the game from there and transitioning from there. We made it really difficult for them.”
Kane had previously gone four games without scoring for Bayern but his two goals mean he now has 31 in all competitions this season.
Since joining Bayern in 2023, he has scored 75 goals in all competitions which is the most by any player in all of Europe’s top five leagues,per the BBC.
His brace on Wednesday also means he’s scored nine goals in the Champions League this season, the most by an English player in a single Champions League campaign and tying the European Cup single-season record with Dennis Viollet who scored nine goals for Manchester United in 1956-57, per the BBC. Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney are the only Englishmen to have scored more than Kane’s nine Champions League knockout goals, with 15 and 14 respectively.
The only negative for Bayern was the injury suffered by captain Manuel Neuer midway through the second half which came in an unlikely fashion.
Neuer appeared to injure himself while celebrating Musiala’s goal, going down to the turf and signaling to the Bayern bench that he was not fit to continue. The 38-year-old was eventually replaced by Jonas Urbig who made his debut for the club.
“In this moment, I have no news about Manuel,” Bayern manager Vincent Kompany said afterwards,per TNT Sports. “But it’s true that when he celebrated the goal, he injured himself. It looks like his calf, but we will have to see now.”
On Thursday,Bayern confirmedthat Neuer will be out for “the foreseeable future” after suffering a torn muscle fiber in his right calf.
On a disappointing evening for Leverkusen, things were made even harder for the reigning German champion when Nordi Mukiele was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half which will mean he’ll miss next week’s second leg.
But Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso isn’t ruling out his side’s chances despite needing a three-goal comeback.
“It will take time to process this game,” Alonso said. “A lot went against us today, but that was our own fault. We didn’t have good control and made big mistakes.
“But it’s not over until it’s over. The craziest things have already happened in football and we’ll fight to make something happen next week.”
Elsewhere on Wednesday, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson put in an inspired performance to help his team snatch a 1-0 victory away at Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
PSG was completely dominant at the Parc des Princes, creating plenty of chances and looking like the only team likely to score on the night.
The French team’s frontline of  Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Ousmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola tormented Liverpool’s defense all evening but found an outstanding Alisson standing before them.
PSG had 28 shots and the Brazilian had to make nine saves – many of them extraordinary feats of athleticism and timing – to keep his team in the game.
Alisson was beaten by a brilliant curling effort from Kvaratskhelia in the first half, but the goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR) for offside.
In the end, Liverpool was able to find a shock winner in the 87th minute when substitute Harvey Elliott netted the only goal of the game just 47 seconds after coming onto the pitch.
After the game, Alisson’s display – for which he earned the Man of the Match award – was the main talking point.
“Alisson, for me, is the best goalkeeper in the world. Has been for years. I think he showed that today,” Liverpool defender Andy Robertsontold UEFAafter the game. “When called upon, he made some fantastic saves.
“The clean sheet, I think the team helped a lot. But I think the clean sheet goes to Alisson today with the amount of saves he had to make.”
Elliott agreed with his teammate Roberston, saying: “Without (Alisson), I don’t know where we’d be.”
It was a tough result for PSG, who lost for the first time in 23 games in all competitions. But PSG manager Luis Enrique said his squad still believes ahead of next week’s second leg.
“It’s difficult to think about the match in a positive way. We deserved to win, clearly,” Enrique said afterwards. “Football many times is unfair and we have to accept that, but we are ready to (go to) Liverpool.
“We don’t have anything to lose.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/europe/kremlin-trump-analysis-propaganda-ukraine-latam-intl/index.html,"It’s a sign of these extraordinary times that even the Kremlin’s old propagandists are scrambling to change their tune.
Across state-controlledRussianmedia, disparaging references to “the collective West” and “Anglo-Saxons” – thinly-veiled diplomatic code for US-led states – have been quietly dropped. Instead, it’s just what the Kremlin calls “the old world” of Europe, without its US partner, being singled out for criticism.
On his top-rated news show, Dmitry Kisylov, a prominent state mouthpiece who once boasted how Russia could reduce theUnited Statesto a smouldering pile of radioactive ash, is now talking about a “great troika,” dominating the globe:China, Russia and the US.
“Now the European war party wants to further escalate the Ukrainian conflict,” Kisylov tells his millions of Russian viewers.

But “if we simplify it, everything now is decided by the great troika - Russia, China and US - that will form the new structure of the world. The European Union as a single political force no longer exists,” he adds.
It is a bleak vision already being played out on the battlefields of Ukraine, where the Trump-administration, determined to end the bloodshed, is piling pressure on an embattled Kyiv.
To the alarm of the Western allies, US President Donald Trump has made breathtaking concessions to the Kremlin, most recently suspendingUS military aid to Ukraine– to the glee of the Kremlin. Trump has also rejected the idea of future NATO membership for the country, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022, and have US security guarantees.
By unilaterally starting negotiations with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and Europe, Trump has begun a controversial process of bringing Moscow in from the diplomatic cold, sowing disunity among Washington’s traditional allies. Both are longtime Kremlin objectives.
Trump’spublic humiliationof Ukrainian President Zelensky during a recent visit to the White House underlined for many Russians just how seismic the US shift has been.
At times, Kremlin-controlled media struggled to reconcile the shocking events.
“On the one hand, Trump speaks about peace, and politicians close to him say they’re interested in Ukraine’s success,” observed Igor Naymushin, a reporter for Russian state media.
“But on the other, from Washington it looks like he’s giving Russia all the cards and tools to successfully continue the special military operation and directly achieve success on the battlefield,” Naymushin added, using a common euphemism in Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
In Russia, the heavily-controlled media reflects the mood of the Kremlin, as do the words of Russian officials now driving home US-European divisions while flip-flopping on Washington’s historical record.

“I do not want to be anti-European,” claimed Sergey Lavrov, the veteran Russian foreign minister. “However…. all the tragedies of the world originated in Europe or happened thanks to European policy. Colonization, wars, crusaders, the Crimean War, Napoleon, World War One, Adolf Hitler. If we look at history in retrospect, the Americans did not play any instigating or even inflammatory role,” he insisted in an interview posted on the official foreign ministry website.
Beyond the flattery, however, it’s hard to see what the US has extracted from Russia in return for Washington’s geopolitical about-face.
Privately, one Russian official told me the US-Russian economic cooperation deals being discussed behind closed doors may have appealed. Such deals are Putin’s “Kryptonite” for a transactional Trump, as one Russian commentator put it.
“Trump is like Superman, and our President (Putin) has found his weakness,” said Nikita Danyuk, a member of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation to Russian state media outlet Channel 1.
“As soon as Trump hears ‘rare earth metals’, it doesn’t matter if those metals are there or not. He forgets about anything and is ready to accept any terms. It’s truly a grandmasters game by our President,” Danyuk said.
Other pro-Kremlin figures, like Olga Skabaeva, a state TV presenter, highlight the free hand the Trump administration appears to have granted Moscow.
After a senior Ukrainian official, Andrey Yermak, posted a social media calling for Russia to “stop its daily shelling of Ukraine, and immediately, if it really wants to end the war,”  Skabaeva responded: “This morning Yermak woke up and thought he was Trump…”
“But he forgot that Trump does not set any conditions for Russia and Putin. Only for Zelensky and Ukraine.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/pope-francis-audio-message-intl-hnk/index.html,"Pope Francis thanked his supporters for their prayers on Thursday in a breathless audio message that nonetheless lifted spirits among his faithful as concerns grow for the 88-year-old pontiff’s health.
The Pope’s pre-recorded remarks, broadcast on loudspeakers at the Vatican’s St. Peter’s Square ahead of the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer, marked the first time supporters heard the pontiff’s voice since his hospitalization around three weeks ago.
“I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square, I accompany you from here. May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you,” Pope Francis said, speaking slowly in his native Spanish in a voice where he struggled to catch his breath.
The square erupted in applause upon hearing Francis’ words, heartened to hear his voice.
Although the Pope has issued written messages from the hospital and the Vatican has given twice-daily updates on his condition, he has not been seen on photo or video since February 14 when he was hospitalized after being plagued by a string of lung-related medical struggles, including bronchitis and double pneumonia.
This is the ailing pontiff’s fourth, andnow longest, hospital stay since he became pope in 2013. Francis has lived with lung-related issues formuch of his life. As a young man, he contracted severe pneumonia and had part of one lung removed.
Doctors said the Pope’s health prognosis remains “reserved” after he had several episodes of acute respiratory failure on Monday, although he has remained stable since, according to the Vatican.
He has not presented any further episodes of respiratory failure and does not have a fever, the Vatican added on Thursday.
The Pope is continuing with respiratory and motor physiotherapy, the Vatican said, adding that he had an active Thursday and engaged in several work activities throughout the day while receiving the Eucharist before lunch.
The Argentinian leader’s schedule has been cleared to accommodate his intensive medical treatment.
He did not lead theAsh Wednesdayservice, which marks the start of Lent, for only the second time in his 12-year papacy, according to the Vatican, and has not led the Angelus prayer for three Sundays in a row.
On Friday morning the Vatican said the Pope had spent a “peaceful night” and woke up shortly after 8 am.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/politics/trump-whiplash-tariffs-ukraine-musk/index.html,"Unpredictability has long been one of PresidentDonald Trump’s strongest assets. The uncertainty that follows is one of his most confounding.
From the financial markets to foreign capitals, a fresh sense of Trump-inspired whiplash reverberated across the globe this week, raising questions about whetherhis decisions on trade, Ukraine aid orthe federal workforceare rooted in strategy or impulse.
“Look, our country’s been ripped off by everybody,” Trump said Friday. “That stops now.”
The seventh week of his presidency was scripted to be something of a triumphant one, with aprime-time addressto a joint session of Congress intended to rally Republicans around his agenda. But the week was instead dominated by what Trump did, not simply what he said, particularly in reversing course on tariffs.
A day after imposing them on Canada and Mexico, he pulled back, acquiescing to the nation’s top automakers by granting a one-month reprieve.
A day later, his decision to backtrack again by delaying even more Mexico-Canada tariffs sent the financial markets into a downward state of confusion.
“I’m not even looking at the market,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, an assertion that drew eye rolls from his advisers and admirers alike.
Related articleTrump tells Cabinet members they’re in charge of staffing as business leaders and Republicans complain about Musk
Whether or not Trump was looking at the stock market, the market was looking at him – wiping out most of the gains made since the November election.
For all the planning that Trump and his advisers engaged in during their four years out of power – preparing a raft of executive orders, writing detailed plans to dramatically reshape the federal workforce and more – the first week of March also presented a fresh reminder that all presidents rise or fall on how they respond to challenges outside of their immediate control.
For Trump, that appears most evident when it comes to the economy and the war in Ukraine, where his efforts to bring an end to the war begun with Russia’s invasion have come with the US softening support for Kyiv and warming up to Moscow.
If the on-again, off-again action on tariffs sent stocks tumbling and executives scrambling, it did not appear to bother Trump.
Indeed, by Friday, the president had veered yet again, threatening a new 250% tariff on Canadian dairy that had gone unmentioned by himself or anyone else in their hours of interviews and press conferences on tariffs over the previous week.
The dairy issue is one the president raised directly with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a telephone call this week that, in his words on Truth Social, ended “in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner.”
As it turns out, the quotation marks around “somewhat” were doing a lot of work. The call, at moments, became highly contentious, officials told CNN, as the leaders exchanged profanity and raised voices to make their points.
There may have been some pent-up anger involved. Trudeau had been trying to get ahold of Trump for days before new 25% tariffs were set to go into effect, but his calls were not being returned.
By the time Trudeau emerged to directly inform “Donald” that his tariffs were a “very dumb thing to do,” it was clear the relationship between the men was toxic and generally irreparable.
White House officials took umbrage at the casual reference to the president by one of his counterparts and already began looking to a time in the near future when Trudeau will no longer be prime minister.
Trump’s call with Trudeau did not immediately result in a reprieve on tariffs, but by the following day he had relented,signing an extensionuntil April on the new duties.
Fresh tensions emerged this week at the White House over Elon Musk and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency as agencies scramble to finalize their reorganization plans before March 13, the next phase of its effort to layoff federal employees and shrink government.
Several members of the Cabinet have complained about a lack of autonomy inside their agencies as they grapple with Musk’s efforts to reshape the bureaucracy. Republicans on Capitol Hill, responding to outrage from their constituents, also voiced concern about deep cuts in their communities and the chaotic fallout.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been among the Cabinet members who have bristled at some of the actions taken by DOGE, officials told CNN, in concerns he has shared with his former colleagues in the Senate.
The State Department was among the agencies that instructed its workforce to disregard Musk’s demand for employees to justify their jobs by replying to a government-wide email detailing five things they accomplished during the week.
In a closed-door meeting this week, where Trump instructed his Cabinet to “keep all the people you want, everybody that you need,” Rubio and other Cabinet members tangled with Musk over competing visions to cut government, officials told CNN. On Friday, Trump downplayed any disagreements, which were first reported by The New York Times.
“No clash, I was there, you’re just a troublemaker,” Trump said, referring to a reporter in the Oval Office who asked about the meeting. “Elon gets along great with Marco, and they’re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.”
Trump has made clear that he endorses the broader vision embraced by Musk, who was among the small clutch of advisers who boarded Air Force One on Friday evening to join the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
The raging conflict in Ukraine has frustrated the president after his self-imposed deadline of ending it within a day of taking office came and went.
He has mostly vented his resentment at Ukraine, including during last week’s fracas in the Oval Office that resulted in President Volodymyr Zelensky being asked to leave the West Wing.
After the dust-up with Zelensky last week, some Trump officials privately doubted there was any way to repair the leaders’ relationship. Many of Trump’s top supporters publicly suggested Zelensky should step down. And on Monday, the White House said it waspausing military assistanceto Kyiv, with it later emerging thatintelligence sharinghad been partially paused too.
But behind the scenes, American officials had been back-channeling with Zelensky and his team, stressing the importance of stabilizing relations with the White House sooner rather than later, urging the Ukrainians to get talks back on track before the president’s speech to Congress.
Among those who reached out to Zelensky was Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, a source familiar with the discussion said. The warning was quickly followed by a conciliatory post from Zelensky on X Tuesday morning in which he called the Oval Office meeting “regrettable.”
The efforts seemed to work.
By Tuesday evening, Trump sounded open to reconciliation. He happily read aloud that morning’s message from Zelensky during an address to Congress. By Thursday, talks had been arranged between American and Ukrainian officials for next week in Saudi Arabia.
“He felt that Zelensky’s letter was a very positive first step,” Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said Thursday. “There was an apology, there was an acknowledgement that the United States has done so much for the country of Ukraine, and a sense of gratitude.”
On Friday, Trump also flashed anger at Russia, however briefly, writing on Truth Social that he was ready to impose new sanctions if Moscow continued “pounding” Ukraine.
But the moment seemed fleeting. Hours later in the Oval Office, he asserted Russian President Vladimir Putin held “all the cards” in the conflict, and said it was understandable why he was hitting Ukraine so hard.
That was more in line with Trump’s typical rhetoric, at least over the past month, which has heavily favored Moscow and sometimes even mirrored the Kremlin’s talking points, all while disparaging Ukraine and its leader.",europe

Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are in negotiations to form a coalition after anational election last month, will put their proposals to the German parliament next week.
Merz, Germany’slikely next chancellor, has seized the moment after the return of Donald Trump to the White House put the transatlantic alliance in turmoil and underlined the urgency for Europe to strengthen its own defenses.
Trump froze military aid to Ukraine after a bitter clash last week with its President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reinforcing fears he could strike a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine while disengaging from Europe.

Economists and investors have urged Germany to reform its constitutionally enshrined state borrowing limits — known as the “debt brake” — in order to free up investment and support aneconomy that has contractedfor the past two years.
“In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, whatever it takes must now also apply to our defense,” Merz, leader of the CDU/CSU conservatives, said Tuesday.
“We are counting on the United States of America to continue to stand by our mutual alliance obligations in the future. But we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defense must now be significantly expanded.”
The euro rose to its strongest level in nearly four months Wednesday after the news. Germany’s blue-chip share index jumped 3.4% as of 4.30 a.m. ET to trade near a record high.
European defense companyshares have soaredin recent days as momentum to ramp up spending across the region gathers pace.
“A really big bazooka,” wrote Berenberg economist Holger Schmieding, commenting on the German measures. “These proposals for an immediate loosening of Germany’s fiscal rules will likely be enacted. They are a fiscal sea change for Germany.”
Merz said the CDU/CSU and SPD would submit a motion to the Bundestag lower house of parliament next week to amend the constitution so defense expenditure above 1% of economic output is exempt from the debt brake.
A commission of experts will separately develop a proposal for modernizing the debt brake to boost investments on a permanent basis.
According to a poll by INSA, 49% of Germans support loosening the debt brake while only 28% are against. But changing the debt rules and creating a special fund require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The conservatives and SPD are rushing to get the moves passed in the outgoing parliament, given far-right and far-left parties will have a blocking minority in the new parliament after scoring strongly in last month’s election.
The radical Left party had already threatened a legal challenge if Germany takes on new debt to fund defense expenditure.
The Greens party, whose support is needed to get the debt brake reform across the line, said it would look at the proposals but made no firm commitment.
“If this succeeds, then the stagnation of the German economy is likely to be overcome quickly,” said Sebastian Dullien of the IMK institute. “Germany is once again economically and militarily capable of taking action.”
Merz said he would meet outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz Wednesday to discuss additional aid for Ukraine, with more than €3 billion on the table.
“Our country is running on wear and tear, and that is why it was important for us to invest, to invest massively, so that our country functions better again,” SPD leader Lars Klingbeil said.
The United States has repeatedly pressured Germany to increase its defense spending to overhaul a military that has felt neglected since the end of the Cold War and diverted weapons to support Ukraine in the war against Russia.
“Pending more clarity on this issue and being mindful of some execution risk, we believe this is one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history,” said Robin Winkler, an economist at Deutsche Bank.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/wwii-bomb-paris-halts-eurostar-travel-london-northern-france-intl-hnk/index.html,"Trains to and from Paris were heavily disrupted following the discovery of an unexploded World War II bomb early on Friday near the world’s third-busiest train station.
Almost 500 trains were canceled and the disruption affected around 600,000 people at the Gare du Nord, the transport minister said.
The bomb, described by a spokesperson for France’s national rail company SNCF as “really huge,” was discovered by construction workers on a site to replace a railway bridge. It was found 2.5km outside of Paris, along railway tracks in the nearby town of Saint Denis.
“The bomb could be a serious threat to people’s lives,” the spokesperson warned. The bomb weighs 500kg, including 200kg of explosives.
The finding led to the severe disruption of both domestic and international travel at Paris’s bustling Gare du Nord station, which an estimated 220 million visitors pass through every year. Services to London and Brussels were hit, Eurostar said.
French transport minister Philippe Tabarot said that train services will gradually resume and roads will reopen later Friday from 6pm local time although it wasn’t immediately clear how the bomb was made safe or disposed of.
“We are delighted and relieved that all these worries are ended,” Tabarot said.
Following the bomb’s discovery, a security perimeter was immediately established, leading to the disruption of the intercity and suburban lines from Gare du Nord, police told CNN.
Later Friday, the security perimeter was extended to 500 meters, according to the Saint Denis town hall. All buildings in the vicinity with windows facing towards the bomb were also evacuated.
Several hundred passengers were inside the Gare du Nord looking for information on Friday morning, CNN saw. The atmosphere was calm, with dozens of train staff and security personnel helping passengers.
One woman told CNN affiliate BFMTV from outside the station, “We were supposed to leave for a weekend in London this morning. The worry is that we will lose €800 worth of hotel rooms if we don’t make the reservation, so that’s a bit of a problem.”
Another woman said, “There is no information being given on the app, only the Eurostar site that says that we can be reimbursed. Aside from that, no further information.”",europe

The traditional Christian feast day before the start of Lent on Ash Wednesday is celebrated as a chance to eat well before the 40 days of sacrifices in the lead-up to Easter.
Shrove Tuesday, which falls on March 4 this year, is also a great excuse — as if one were needed — to eat pancakes, as they usually combine butter and eggs, rich foods that were historically given up for the season of reflection.
That also explains why, in the United States, Shrove Tuesday is better known as Mardi Gras — or “Fat Tuesday.”
The Shrove Tuesday tradition of eating pancakes, celebrated by Christians of all denominations, dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.
That’s when a “pancake bell” — yes, really — would be rung to call Christians to confession, where they’d be absolved from their sins, or “shriven,” as they used to say.
But pancakes — in all sorts of forms, made from all sorts of ingredients — have graced tables around the world for millennia, across every culture and creed.
Although finding a definitive pancake definition is difficult, and doubtless contentious, here are some of the very best pancakes around the world.
Hailing from the regions of Provence in France and Liguria in Italy, where they are known as farinata, these pancakes are simply crafted from chickpea flour, water, olive oil and seasoning.
Traditionally cooked in large copper pans of oil placed in wood-fired ovens, these irresistible treats are a great gluten-free alternative to pizza. Socca is also a street food favorite in cities like Nice, where its served in paper cones and dusted with black pepper.

In Russia and other Slavic countries, these thin, round pancakes made with buckwheat flour and yeast usually come in bigger versions than those seen in many fine dining restaurants, where they’re often topped with caviar or smoked salmon.
A staple of Russian cuisine, Blinis tend to come to the fore around Shrove Tuesday in a week of celebrations called Maslenitsa, or ‘“Pancake Week”. Pancakes every day for a week? We love the sound of it.
Dietary restrictions and preferences have seen countless takes on pancakes, but few can rival the delicious creativity of hemp protein pancakes from Michelin-starred chef Sven Wassmer at Verve by Sven at Switzerland’s Grand Resort Bad Ragaz.
Switzerland is known for its healthy breakfasts, and Wassmer’s gluten-free pancakes featuring hemp protein instead of flour, with toppings including bananas, almonds, maple syrup — and maybe just a touch of whipped cream — certainly fit the bill.

Unlike most pancakes, these fragrant, crispy triangles are actually made from dough, rather than batter, bringing about a crispy, flaky and chewy texture.
Easy enough to make at home, some people like to dip them in sauces with soy or chili. But they’re great just as they are – hot from the pan or wok, flaky with the subtle kick of scallions. Regional variations include those from Shanghai which feature pork fat for extra decadence.

French crepes would take some beating in the Pancake Hall of Fame — if there’s not one, there should be. These ultra-thin pancakes originated in Brittany in northwest France, way back in the 13th century, but have since become beloved the world over.
They can be either sweet with fillings like fruit preserves, syrups or chocolate, or savory, famously with ham and cheese, melted to perfection.
Watching them being prepared is true culinary theater, as the batter is slowly coaxed to perfect consistency before being expertly folded over.
Thick and fluffy, drenched in maple syrup and often served with the contrast of salty, crispy bacon, few pancakes rival the decadence of a classic stack of American pancakes.
American recipes for pancakes date back to 1796 and “American Cookery’” by Amelia Simmons, even if her suggestion of “Indian Slapjacks,” made from cornmeal, have largely been forgotten.
Today, the use of buttermilk in these classics leads to a finer crumb, extra fluffiness and a subtle tang. Wherever they’re served, just make sure to pile them high.
A celebrated dish from Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, Latkes contain another uncommon ingredient in the form of potato. But it wasn’t always so, as until the popularity of spuds grew in Eastern Europe in the 19th century, the recipe was all about cheese.
Today grated potato, onions and eggs combine to make gloriously crispy fritters that are topped with sour cream, apple sauce, lox and more.

Potato also features in this terrific Indian take on a pancake that can reach an extraordinary size. A popular breakfast treat in south India, but eaten throughout the day elsewhere, the batter is made from fermented rice and lentils, while the fragrant filling features potatoes with mustard seeds, coconut, turmeric and coriander.
They’re served with chutneys, which vary throughout the country, such as coconut, tomato, coriander or peanut, making for brilliant communal eating.
Traditional pancakes in England would quite possibly make an American wince. Small and thin, they’re a million miles from the maple syrup-covered stacks so beloved in the US.
But there’s no doubting their own simple, elegant charms – assuming that you’ve managed to keep them in the pan, after tossing them in the air.
There’s really only one way to have them on Pancake Tuesday, as Brits call it: with a squeeze of lemon juice and sprinkling of granulated sugar.
China’s second entry comes in the form of the classic gossamer-thin translucent flour pancakes used to wrap slow-cooked Peking duck.
Plain flour, water and salt are the humble ingredients used to make the dough, before the pancakes are gently cooked in a steamer basket.
Then layer in your duck, add scallions and either hoisin or sweet bean sauce.  At Woo Cheong Tea House in Hong Kong, Okinawa brown sugar is added to the duck sauce, making them even more irresistible.
OK, it’s technically more of an unleavened flatbread, but beloved Ethiopian staple injera, a spongy and slightly sour creation made from teff flour, also ticks our pancake boxes. Here flour is mixed with water and ersho, similar to a sourdough starter, triggering fermentation.
This mixture is then poured in a pan or onto a traditional circular griddle called a mitad, ensuring a smooth underside and porous top perfect for scooping and soaking up sauces and other flavors.
From the wild and beautiful Brittany region of northwest France, Breton galettes are a take on pancakes that make locals exceedingly proud.
These delicacies are made with healthy buckwheat flour folded over into squares to envelop not-so-healthy savory fillings such as ham, eggs, bacon, or cheese.
Galettes are great when paired with a glass of apple cider — but don’t forget that in France, it contains alcohol.
Particularly popular in the Washington state, these unusually named pancakes are also known as a Bismarck or a popover — while Brits would be forgiven for calling them Yorkshire puddings.
But there’s no confusion over the cooking method — they’re baked in metal pans in the oven. In the US, the puffy pancakes are often topped with butter, sugar and a squeeze of lemon or syrup.
The Canton of Obwalden sits right in the heart of Switzerland and is home to these unusual pancakes which are shredded before being served, usually at dinner.
Cholermus is cooked in butter and when they’re nearly done, the treats are cut up and fried until a perfect golden brown. Serve with sugar, a dusting of cinnamon and apple sauce. And probably repeat.
These small and fluffy pancakes are as proudly Australian as Vegemite. However, they’re not to be confused with a British dish of the same name.
Down under, baking powder is added to the batter to make them rise. Once golden, they’re stacked and traditionally topped with cream, sugar and fresh strawberries — or strawberry jelly.

One of the world’s most delicious savory pancakes comes from Korea, and its hot, spicy and crispy combination of ingredients will have you coming back for more.
Kimchi is the beloved traditional Korean side dish of fermented vegetables, added to flour, eggs and more to make a batter. Once pan-fried, unique flavors combine into a sizzling, crunchy pancake, perfect for dipping — or eating just as it comes.
Finally, to Venezuela and their fabulous thin, cheesy corn pancakes known as cachapas. The use of fresh or frozen corn provides the batter with a defined sweetness, while fresh cheese and butter make for irresistible fillings.
The key, as with almost our global selection of pancakes, is in the way they’re cooked. Fry them until they’re golden and crispy before letting the queso de mano cheese melt in the middle.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/europe/ukraine-war-us-policy-shifts-analysis-intl/index.html,"The seismic shift of the past fortnight is hard to digest.
Ukraine and its allies hope, deeply, that the plank Kyiv has been slammed in the face with, is – to paraphrase US President Donald Trump’s presidential envoy to Ukraine – just to get its attention. That the White House is merelypausing military aidandintelligence sharing, demanding about half of thecountry’s mineral wealthto repay an alleged debt, and expecting a public apology from its president, as a negotiating ploy. That this is just tough talk ahead of a hard deal.
But a deeper change is apparent, and one that Europe has been reluctant to accept, and is scrambling to adjust to. The Trump administration sees itself not as an ally to Ukraine and its European backers, but as an intermediary between them and Moscow, hoping to rehabilitate Russia on the world stage. Trump has said he is “seriously considering” more sanctions on Moscow. Yet he has not applied them. So far, Russia has only tasted carrots and felt no sticks.
Related articleRussia’s goals are unchanged, Zelensky says, as strikes kill 11 in eastern Ukraine
The pressure applied so far ahead of any deal is that of the contractor on its subcontractors – America on Ukraine and Europe – squeezing their terms to create a more attractive proposition for Russia. Hopes are high that a summit in Riyadh on Tuesday, between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s team, will heal theKyiv-Washington relationship.
Yet almost too much hinges on this meeting. Personal enmities must be put aside. A deal on rare earths and other minerals – which is, in the last draft CNN saw, essentially toothless yet a bold sign of American ambitions as to Ukraine’s natural wealth – must be inked. And, most importantly, the White House must reveal what sort of peace it has in mind.
This is the chasm that lies beneath Trump’s insistence that Zelensky “commit to peace.” Does Trump mean an indefinable vibe only he can determine? Does he mean the germs of a European peace plan, which so far involves a prisoner swap, a partial ceasefire at sea, in the air and on energy infrastructure, followed by a limited European peacekeeping force? (Russian officials have rejected much of this already). Or does he mean another version of peace that may be concocted between Moscow and Washington, without Europe or Ukraine at the table?
This last idea should be the most troubling for European security and Ukrainian sovereignty. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, denied that a draft deal discussed in March 2022 in Istanbul – a rushed peace bid which fell apart in the early stages of the war due to the massacres in Irpin of Ukrainian civilians – would be the framework. But he called it a “departure point, at least.”
These proposed accords demanded that Ukraine relinquish its ambitions to join NATO, an aim which is now enshrined in the country’s constitution. The draft deal also demanded major cultural changes, the least of which was Russian being made an official language.
But above all, it tried to set limits on the armed forces Ukraine could retain which would have made them significantly smaller than Russia’s vast military. Its essence was capitulation. Not in terms of submitting to peace. But in removing Ukraine’s ability to convincingly defend itself in the event that Russia, as Ukraine says it has done more than 20 times in the last decade, violates a ceasefire and attacks again.

The pressure being laid onto Ukraine would suggest Tuesday’s meeting in Riyadh – already extremely high stakes after theOval Office catastrophejust over a week ago – is not intended to be a simple, glad-handing moment of making up. We may learn the kind of peace Trump envisions, and how much of that mirrors Moscow’s ambitions.
Europe’s future security depends on how much “art of the deal” there is in this deal. Trump’s accustomed business world is one where he would seek to make a purchase or a contract attractive to the other side. Perhaps he might fire the head of the subcontractor if the other side didn’t like them (hence the loose talk of Zelensky’s fitness for office). He might screw down on their terms to improve margins (pausing military aid). He might flatter his prospective client (his reluctance to speak ill of Putin).
But the deal would ultimately involve the purchase of bricks and mortar, or their construction: a simple and predictable future course of actions or change in ownership of property, protected and cosseted by lawyers and courts – by the rule of law. If the other side broke the deal, Trump could sue. The precedents and courses of action were well-defined, and the rule of law on his side in ensuring the terms of the deal were kept.
Russia is not a massive fan of the rule of law. It negotiates normally to buy time to pursue its military goals. It seized the eastern Ukrainian town of Debaltseve literally during the first days of a ceasefire in 2015, negotiated following its limited invasion of Ukraine the previous year. Putin was raised in the KGB, lives on a diet of “maskirovka” (masking) and openly denied it was his troops who invaded Crimea in 2014, before laughingly accepting they were actually his a few years later. Were he a business, his credit rating would probably be distressed.
But Trump’s belief, his hunch, that Putin can be trusted and wants peace, is now guiding US policy, and rewriting America’s role in the largest war in Europe since the 1940s.
Signs of the damage this psychological blow has inflicted are already bubbling to the surface. Ukrainian forces are in peril in the Kursk region, and may lose this sliver of Russian land that was their only territorial card at the negotiating table. If they fall, the North Korean and Russian troops engaged there can then turn their attention to the rest of the eastern frontline where Moscow has made slow progress for months.
Ballistic missile and drone attacks have caused ahorrific loss of civilian lifethis weekend, even after Trump threatened sanctions for Moscow “pounding” Ukraine, and may worsen as the pause in military aid reduces the US-supplied Patriots that Ukraine has depended on for air defense for its cities.
So far, the collapse in American support for Ukraine has mostly been confined to wild theater in foreign capitals. This week, we may learn details of the unclear peace Trump seeks. And then the grim toll of these remote, sanitary hotel meetings in suits will likely turn into dust and loss across Ukraine.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/world/ukraine-military-aid-trump-visualized-dg/index.html,"President Donald Trump recentlyhalted all future shipments of military aidto Ukraine after a heated meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week exacerbated a chasm in US-Ukraine relations.
Western alliesanticipatethat Ukraine could sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks before the stoppage in US assets would start to affect operations.
With the pause likely to remain in place until Trump is satisfied with what he sees as Zelensky’s commitment to peace talks, CNN looks at what exactly was in the military aid sent by the United States so far, how much was sent and how a prolonged halt could start to impact Ukraine’s war efforts.
The US is the largest single donor to the war-torn nation, sending at least $123 billion in total aid to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Military aid made up $69 billion of that, or 56% of the US total, according todata from Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine.
See how aid from the US, the European Union and its institutions, and all other countries stacks up:
Ukraine has expanded its domestic production of military equipment including the manufacturing of drones and artillery munitions. This week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said it now produces more than 30% of the equipment and ammunition needed to defend itself.
Zelensky has stated that military supplies from the US cover about 40% of its defense needs, with other — mostly European — allies making up the other approximately 30%.
Europe has rallied behind Ukraine in recent days, pledging to strengthen its support for Kyiv as US foreign policy shifts away.
On Tuesday, the EU announced a plan to allow member states to borrow $158 billion to boost defense spending and supply weapons to Ukraine.
Among the specific equipment sent from the US to Ukraine are air defense systems, drones, rocket launchers, radars, tanks and anti-armor weapons.
The US has been supplying Ukraine with military equipment under the Presidential Drawdown Authority since August 2021 in response to Russia preparing to launch its full-scale invasion. The mechanism allows the president to draw equipment for Ukraine directly from US stocks.
The US has used this method on 55 occasions to provide about $31.7 billion worth of military assistance for Ukraine,according to a reportfrom the State Department.
Stopping the flow of this aid could be disastrous for Ukraine, with one Ukrainian officialwarningthat the country could run out of vital artillery shells by May or June.
While the EU may help fill some gaps, there are some things only the US can provide, for example thePatriot air defense system, which has proven uniquely effective in countering Russian ballistic missiles. The US controls the licensing and the production of that system and its missiles.
A Ukrainian official told CNN on Tuesday that Kyiv’s stocks of Patriot missiles could run out in a matter of weeks, though it’s unclear how many missiles Ukraine already had stockpiled and whether more supplies were already en route from the US.
As Ukraine’s top military aid donor, the US has sent the most howitzers (a type of artillery weapon), anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile systems and multiple launch rocket systems. Meanwhile, Poland has supplied and pledged the most tanks, Kiel Institute data shows.
It will be extremely difficult for Ukraine’s European allies to fill the gap left by the US. In 2023, overall military expenditures for the 27 EU member states and the United Kingdom totaled around $388 billion, whereas the US spent $916 billion, or about two times as much. The US also allocated 9% of government spending to defense, which was the highest among NATO countries, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

In travel news this week: A German city cracks down on bad nudist etiquette, Western travelers visit North Korea, plus where to go for a US urban vacation.
If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right — and public nudity is no exception.
Beach wardens in Rostock, Germany, now have the power to issue bans to people wearing clothing on its naturist-only beaches.
The new regulation is because city offices “received numerous complaints from people who felt harassed in the naturist (or nudist) areas,” Rostock Tourism’s Moritz Naumann told CNN, and it’s intended only to be used in “case of conflict.”
There’s etiquette on nude beaches that should be followed.
Common infractions include staring, taking photos and unwanted comments, experts including Stéphane Deschênes, president of the International Naturist Federation (INF-FNI), told CNN last year in our guide tonude beach etiquette.
Rostock has 15 kilometers of beach (about nine miles), divided into naturist-only, mixed and textile-only — so all guests’ needs are covered, even if their bits and bobs aren’t.
Naturism has traditionally been hugely popular in Germany (read more in our story onFree Body Culture), but the movement is waning among younger generations.
Naumanntells CNN that city authorities have observed that “the number of people practicing it today is decreasing. Therefore, we have reduced the number of naturist beaches from 37 to 27 blocks with the new regulation.”
There are, however, still plenty of sandy spots where you can disrobe freely around the world. Here are 24 of the world’sbest nude beaches, from California to New Zealand.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/04/world/german-detained-ice-intl-latam/index.html,"AGermantattoo artist who tried to enter the United States from Mexico through the San Diego border has been inImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detentionfor over a month, according to a friend who witnessed her being detained.
Jessica Brösche, a Berlin-based tattoo artist, had been vacationing in Mexico when she decided to travel to the US from Tijuana with an American friend, Nikita Lofving. But at the San Ysidro port of entry immigration authorities took Brösche into custody.
“They took her right in front of me as we were walking over,” Lofving, a clothing designer based in Los Angeles, told CNN. “Two hours passed, and then she called me and said, ‘Hey, I’m gonna get deported back to Germany. I’ll call you from Germany in a couple of days.’”
The call was on January 25. Brösche has been in detention ever since, half a month past when she originally hoped to leave the US on February 15, Lofving says.
According to the ICE Detainee Locator, Brösche is currently in the Otay Mesa Detention Facility, in San Diego County, while she awaits deportation. CNN reached out to both ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ask why she was detained.
A spokesperson from CBP toldCNN affiliate KGTVthat if a foreign national denied admission to the US is unable to book travel back to their country of origin “he or she will be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”
In a statement to KGTV, an ICE spokesperson wrote that Brösche is in detention due “to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.”
Related articleThe pace of Trump’s deportation flights is so far similar to Biden’s
Lovfing told CNN that her German friend was joining her in Los Angeles to tattoo her. She speculated that immigration officials may have misinterpreted Brösche’s statements about the project as a declaration that she’d come to the US to work.
“I mean, shewascoming to work, but not really for money,” Lofving said. “We have an agreement between artists. She’s one of my best friends. We’ve been working on this tattoo project on my body for the last five or six years, and in exchange, I make clothes for her.”
In a phone interview with KGTV last month, Brösche said that she had been kept in “horrible” solitary confinement for eight days when she entered US custody.
“I just want to get home, you know? I’m really desperate,” Brösche told KGTV from Otay Mesa. “I don’t really understand why it’s taking so long to get back to Germany.”
Lofving said that Brösche’s friends and family are hoping that she’ll be out of detention and on a flight back to Germany on March 11, and that her mother bought her a plane ticket home. They aren’t sure whether ICE will let her out by then, however.
“We sent (Brösche) back the information for the tickets, and she told her ICE agent,” Lofving continued, saying the ICE agent had said, “No, you have to get the ticket approved before you buy it.”
A spokesperson from the German Consulate in LA told CNN in an email that they are “aware of the case and in close contact about it with the relevant US authorities as well as with family and close friends of the person concerned.”
CoreCivic, the private prison company that operates Otay Mesa, told CNN that the company “does not know the circumstances of individuals when they are placed in our facilities.”
“Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to,” said spokesperson Ryan Gustin.
Jeff Joseph, president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CNN that Brösche’s case is “fairly unusual.” Brösche, who entered the US via the Visa Waiver Program agreement that the US has with Germany and 40 other countries, would usually have been deported immediately rather than sit in detention for over a month, Joseph said.
By entering on the waiver program, a tourist waives their right to any kind of litigation, Joseph explained.
But normally, a tourist denied entry to the US would be allowed to withdraw their application for admission. “Instead of being subjected to deportation proceedings, they’re allowed to kind of get back on the airplane and turn around and go home, and that does not appear to have happened in this case,” Joseph continued.
In any case, Joseph said that Brösche’s extended stay in Otay Mesa is “extremely concerning.”",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/politics/meanwhile-jd-vance-analysis-intl/index.html,"Editor’s Note:This analysis was originally published in CNN’s Meanwhile in America newsletter. Read past issues and subscribehere.
JD Vance is a different kind of vice president.
He’s not the Machiavellian master of Washington who works in the shadows  – like Dick Cheney. Neither is he the safe pair of foreign policy hands – like a George H.W. Bush or Joe Biden.
The youthful Vance seems instead to have fashioned himself as the personification of his boss Donald Trump’s most extreme social media posts. Hisprovocation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyin the Oval Office last week ignited a diplomatic crisis. He relished traveling to Munich to insult America’s European allies. And Vance was front-page news in Britain after saying Ukraine needed better security guarantees than those offered by “some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” Vance later said it was “absurdly dishonest” to say he was talking about Britain and France – but those were the only allies to publicly volunteer for a Ukraine peace force.
Vance knows which way the wind is blowing in the Republican Party. That’s why he ditched his contempt for the President – afterreportedly wondering in 2016whether Trump might be America’s Hitler. Now, in a party that worships its leader, the vice president is one of the president’s most prominent public admirers.
But Vance is a fascinating character. He rose from a hard scrabble upbringing in the Appalachians to the Ivy League. He’s exceedingly smart – one reason why his political positioning is often taken as evidence of nefarious calculation. Vance, who briefly served as an Ohio senator, despises traditional media and Washington elites so he’s a natural fit with Trump’s populism. He’s also a US Marine veteran – so he ought to know better about the contribution of US allies to the war on terror. And he got rich in Silicon Valley and has an in with the big tech barons who’ve moved sharply to the right and embraced Trump in his second term.
The vice president made his name with “Hillbilly Elegy” a memoir about his childhood in deprived areas of Ohio and Kentucky. The 2016 book explained how deindustrialization fostered poverty and drug addiction and an eventual political backlash against globalized free trade policies. It became a kind of handbook for understanding Trump supporters in his first term.
Given that background, it’s not surprising that Vance produced the campaign’s most eloquent arguments for an America First economic policy. At 40, he’s a potential heir to Trump – although the president amusingly refused to anoint him in a recent Fox News interview, unwilling to think about ceding his throne so soon.
Vance is the epitome of what many Europeans disdain about America. An isolationist, he sees no vital national interest in Ukraine. His bluntness and hint of smugness irk many foreigners, as does his support for Europe’s far-right – including Germany’s extremist AfD. A day before confronting Zelensky in the Oval Office, he rebuked Keir Starmer over free speech in the UK – although the British PM shut him down.
Since Vance is young, ambitious, ideological, and has an apparent chip on his shoulder about establishment intellectuals,  there’s one vice president he does remind us of – Richard Nixon.
When Nixon joined Dwight Eisenhower’s ticket in 1952, he’d spent about enough time in the Senate to have a cup of coffee – just like Vance. And like his 21st century successor, he was a new breed of GOP ideologue – while the current VP upbraids “woke” liberals, Nixon hounded supposed communists living in the United States. And like Vance, Nixon had his eye on higher things. His ambitions and penchant for the dark side of politics sometimes caused tensions with his more experienced boss – a possible omen for the relationship between Trump and Vance.
Nixon used his eight-year vice presidency as a crash course in global affairs that was key to his success as a statesman after he finally won the big job in 1968. Vance however seems unlikely to emulate Nixon’s long global odysseys – he has political interests back home.
But don’t underestimate Vance. He’s risen high and fast. But will hubris lead him to fly too close to the sun?
The Liberal Party will elect a successor to its unpopular leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday and that person will quickly replace him as prime minister. The favorite is Mark Carney – the former governor of the banks of Canada and England. Former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation was instrumental in Trudeau’s fall, hopes to beat him to the top job.
Suddenly, the Liberal leadership looks worth having. Trump’s trade blitzkrieg and demands for Canada to become the 51st state have transformed politics north of the border. Trudeau’s party once looked doomed to defeat by Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party in an election due by the fall. But Poilievre’s Trumpy themes left him exposed and Liberal’s deficit in the polls has evaporated.
The big question now is what is next? Carney doesn’t currently have a seat in parliament, so will have to seek one at the earliest opportunity in a by-election if he becomes PM.
But might he take a gamble and try to exploit an explosion of patriotism and antipathy towards Trump by calling a snap general election? If he were to lose, he’d become a political punchline. But fortune favors the brave – and this may be the Liberals’ only chance of a shock rebound.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/sport/paulo-fonseca-lyon-ban-spt-intl/index.html,"Paulo Fonseca, the head coach of Frenchsoccerteam Olympique Lyonnais, has been given a nine-month suspension after confronting a referee – a sanction the club described as “severe” and “unprecedented.”
Fonseca went face-to-face with referee Benoit Millot at the end of Lyon’s 2-1 victory against Brest on Sunday, shouting at the official as he was shown a red card before being ushered away by his players.
On Wednesday, France’s Professional Football League (LFP) announced that Fonseca would be banned from accessing the bench, the officials’ locker room, and all official functions before, during and after matches until November 30.
It also said that he would be unable to access the players’ locker rooms, the pitch, the stadium tunnel, and all corridors leading to these areas until September 15.
The ban, however, does not apply to European fixtures, according to theAssociated Press, meaning that Fonseca can take charge of the squad on Thursday when Lyon plays Romanian side FCSB in the Europa League knockout stages.
In aYouTube videoexplaining the incident, Ligue 1 said that Millot had shown “remarkable” composure in dealing with Fonseca’s “violent behavior,” while the French refereeing union (SAFE)describedhead contact with a match official as an “act of brutality.”
The Portuguese manager’s angry reaction came as Millot reviewed a potential penalty for Brest in stoppage time, which was ultimately not awarded. Fonseca later apologized for his actions in his post-match press conference.
Last week, SAFE said that its membersreserved the right to resignif they or their loved ones were placed in danger due to abuse directed at officials.
The sanction takes immediate effect, three days after the initial incident.
“Olympique Lyonnais acknowledges the extreme severity of the unprecedented sanction and the unusual speed with which the disciplinary committee dealt with Paulo Fonseca,” the club said in a statement on Wednesday.
“The club deplores the fact that its coach was not judged solely on his actions, an emotional reaction, with no obvious intention of physically attacking the referee.
“In light of a sanction that seems to be dictated by a harmful context affecting French refereeing, OL is announcing that it is studying all possible avenues of appeal. More than ever, the club is united and focused on its sporting objectives.”
In wishing Fonseca happy birthday on his Instagram Stories on Wednesday, Lyon owner John Textor acknowledged that the coach “made a mistake” and had apologized, but added: “Your punishment is clearly too severe. You are the right man for OL and we shall persevere.”
Meanwhile, Fonseca’s wife, Katerina, posted on her Instagram Stories: “9 months for a few seconds of screaming? An absurd, absolutely scandalous, unprecedented decision.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/08/europe/russia-strikes-ukrainians-killed-zelensky-intl/index.html,"Russian missiles killed 11 people overnight in strikes on Ukraine’s eastern city of Dobropillia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday, saying such attacks “prove that Russia’s goals are unchanged.”
The attacks come as the Ukrainian war is at a critical point, with the United States having halted military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv as part of efforts to pressure it into accepting a peace agreement. The move has left Ukraine even more vulnerable to Russian attacks.
On Friday, after threatening Russia with sanctions to force through a ceasefire, US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was “doing what anybody else would do” in taking advantage of the current battlefield dynamics.
In addition to those killed, the latest strikes injured more than 30 others, Zelensky said, including five children.
Authorities said that more people could be trapped under the rubble, with at least eight residential buildings in the area damaged in the attack.
The Ukrainian president described the strikes as “a vile and inhumane tactic of intimidation that Russians often use.”
“Therefore, it is crucial to continue to do everything to protect lives, strengthen our air defense, and increase sanctions against Russia,” Zelensky said, adding that “everything that helps Putin finance the war must break.”
Zelensky has said he will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia next week ahead of negotiations between Kyiv and Washington. After that, his team will stay in Saudi Arabia “to work with our American partners,” he added.

Local officials said on Saturday that over the past day, Russian attacks had killed at least 23 people and injured more than 50 in eastern and southern Ukraine.
In addition to those killed in Dobropillia, Russian attacks elsewhere in Donetsk killed nine others and wounded 13, according to local authorities.
Ukraine’s emergency service said that a drone attack in the eastern Kharkiv region also killed three people and injured seven, while five people were injured in attacks on the southern Kherson region, according to local officials.
Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 79 out of 145 drones launched by Russia overnight, while 54 drones did not reach their target.
Russia also used at least three missiles in its attack, the air force said, adding that it shot down at least one of the projectiles.
The attacks came just days after a deadly Russian airstrike on Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Zelensky.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in the Russian region of Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.
Although the invasion may have slowed Russia’s offensive in Ukraine, Kyiv has since lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk. Moscow has called in foreign reinforcements anddeployed some 12,000 North Korean troopsto the region, according to Ukrainian officials and Western intelligence reports.
This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/sport/chelsea-squad-value-uefa-spt-intl/index.html,"Chelsea’s squad at the end of the 2024 financial year was the most expensive ever assembled inEuropein terms of transfer fees, according to a report released by governing body UEFA.
The “European Club Finance and Investment Landscape” report said Chelsea spent 1.656 billion euros ($1.79 billion) on combined transfer costs.
That comfortably surpassed the value of Manchester United’ssquadin 2023, which cost 1.42 billion euros to assemble, and the 1.33 billion euros spent by Real Madrid, which was the highest squad cost in 2020.
Chelsea have signed 41 players since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022, but the west London club’s big-money transfers have not translated to significant on-field success, as Chelsea finished sixth in the Premier League last season and are currently fifth.

According to the report which analyzes all of Europe’s top divisions,Real Madrid(1.073 billion euros),Manchester City(854 million euros), Paris St.-Germain (808 million euros), Manchester United (771 million euros) andBayern Munich(765 million euros) had the highest revenues in 2023.
The Premier League had nine teams among the top-20 earning clubs, with an average revenue of 357 million euros and approximate aggregate revenue of 7.15 billion euros.
Spain’s LaLiga was second with revenues of 3.7 billion euros, with Germany’s Bundesliga (3.6 billion euros), Italy’s Serie A (2.9 billion euros) and France’s Ligue 1 (2.4 billion euros) rounding out the top five.
The top 20 clubs have been relatively stable across the last decade, with all of the current top 20 featuring in the top 25 in 2014.
English clubs reported just over 7.1 billion euros of revenue in 2023, but the size of the top clubs meant the mean club revenue (357 million euros) is considerably higher than the median (10-11th) club revenue of 245 million euros.
“This ‘typical’ median English club revenue has 60% more revenue than the typical German club and three times the revenue of the typical club in Italy and Spain, principally due to the large TV revenue distributions enjoyed by all top divisionclubsin England,” the report said.
Europe’s 700-plus top-division clubs recorded aggregate revenue of 26.8 billion euros in 2023, with England’s 20 top-flight clubs reporting almost double the revenue (97% more) than either the second and third highest leagues in 2023, Spain and Germany.
England and Germany have by far the largest attendance figures, which is reflected in their median gate revenues of 29.1 million euros and 23.7 million euros, respectively.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/world/russia-aerial-assault-ukraine-us-pause-military-aid-intl/index.html,"Russia fired cruise and ballistic missiles atUkrainein a major overnight attack, Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday, as the Ukrainian president renewed his plea for a partial ceasefire at the end of a week in which theUnited Statessuspended military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.
Russia’s assault targeted several regions across Ukraine, using nearly 70 missiles and almost 200 drones, Zelensky said on X, adding that the “massive” attack was “directed against infrastructure that ensures normal life.”
Following the strikes, Zelensky again stressed his desire for a partial ceasefire – a plan first floated by French President Emmanuel Macron and since discussed by Ukraine’s European allies, who met Thursday in Brussels for a crucial European Union defense summit.
Echoing the plan outlined by Macron, Zelensky said he hoped there can be “silence in the skies – banning the use of missiles, long-range drones and aerial bombs,” as well as “silence at sea – a real guarantee of normal navigation.”

He added later Friday that “the most intensive work ever” is underway with US President Donald Trump’s teamahead of Zelensky’s visitto Saudi Arabia next week for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.
But the Trump administration has dealt further blows to Ukraine this week, pausing military shipments to the country and cutting off intelligence sharing.
The White House also has suspended Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery purchased by the US government through the company Maxar, spokespeople for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Maxar said Friday. Kyiv has long used this overhead imagery to track Russian troop movements, assess terrain and help in the planning of military operations.
After weeks of more amicable relations with Russia, Trump issued a surprising threat to Moscow on Friday, saying “based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine,” he is considering placing large-scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it agrees to a ceasefire and final peace settlement.
“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,” Trump said on TruthSocial.
But despite Trump’s harsh tone, the prospect of higher tariffs will mean little to Moscow, given the tiny amounts of trade between the US and Russia. Last year, Russia exported just $3.5 billion of goods to the US, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.
The halting of American military equipment may have devastating effects on Ukraine’s capabilities andcould leave millions of civiliansvulnerable to Russian missile strikes.
Russia’s overnight barrage included 43 cruise missiles, including eight Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as three Iskander ballistic missiles and 194 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force.
The air force said it downed 134 projectiles, including 25 of the cruise missiles, all eight Kalibr missiles, a guided aircraft missile and 100 drones – but it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound.
However, it was unable to repel the ballistic missiles, which travel at about five times the speed of sound. The only weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal capable of downing ballistic missiles is the US-made Patriot system, which were already in short supply before the US cut off military aid to Kyiv.
Zelensky said that F-16 fighter jets, as well as Mirage aircraft provided by France, had been used to help repel the attack, and that the Mirages had successfully intercepted some of the cruise missiles.
In the late hours of Friday, Russian strikes on the city of Dobropillia in eastern Ukraine killed at least five people and injured another 18, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin, said in a Telegram post. Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa also endured a wave of drone attacks late on Friday, said the head of the Odesa region military administration Oleh Kiper.
Russia’s Defense Ministry meanwhile said its air defenses shot down 43 Ukrainian drones over several regions in a span of two and a half hours on Friday.
Over the week since Zelensky’s disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Ukrainian leader has tacked more closely to his European allies. Led by Macron, several European leaders are pushing for a one-month ceasefire that could pave the way for a more lasting peace.
“The first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life. And this is something that can be effectively monitored,” Zelensky said after the overnight attack.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is under severe pressure in Kursk and may soon lose a key logistical support route to its forces in the Russian region, according to Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers, after the arrival of fresh North Korean troops bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders.
Ukraine launched a shock incursion into Kursk in August – the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – in the hope that it could divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and improve its hand ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations.

This week, military bloggers from both countries have warned that Ukraine’s hold on the territory is more tenuous than at any point since it launched the incursion, with Moscow’s forces entering Ukraine’s Sumy region and threatening to cut off Kyiv’s troops in Kursk.
“The situation in the Kursk sector is very difficult – Russian troops have entered Sumy region,” Andriy Tsaplienko, a prominent Ukrainian military blogger, wrote on Telegram on Friday.
Tsaplienko warned that “Russian troops are rushing towards the road to Sudzha,” a major town in Kursk, in order to “cut off the Ukrainian bridgehead.” He added that Russia is “also trying to reach Zhuravka,” a village in Ukraine’s Sumy region just a few hundred meters from the Russia-Ukraine border.
In a major report last month, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, estimated that Ukraine has at most 30,000 troops stationed in the region, while Russia has gathered around 78,000 troops, including the North Koreans.
One Russian military blogger suggested that Moscow’s gains could be tied to the United States’ decision this week to pause intelligence sharing with Ukraine’s military.
“The breakthrough in Kursk regions… occurred exactly two days after the Americans stopped issuing target designations for cruise missiles and missiles of the ‘HIMARS’ system on the territory of Kursk region,” Yuriy Podolyka wrote on Telegram.
In the face of Russia’s gains, some Ukrainian bloggers have suggested that the Kursk incursion may have exhausted its strategic value.
“I didn’t think I would ever say this. But maybe it’s time to ‘close the shop’ from the Kursk direction. It’s hard for our guys there,” said Serhii Flesh. “As a diversion of enemy resources, I think this operation has long since justified itself.  As a political bargaining card, it is now questionable.”",europe

The suspects were detained on Wednesday, the same day Romania - a European Union and NATO member state - declared the Russian embassy’s military attache and his deputy personae non grata for what it said were acts contravening diplomatic rules.
Moscow has said it will respond to the move.
“The members of the criminal group repeatedly contacted agents of a foreign power, located both in Romania and the Russian Federation,” anti-organized crime prosecutors agency DIICOT said in a statement, which did not name the suspects.
Romania’s intelligence agency SRI said the two expelled Russian diplomats “collected information in areas of strategic interest and took measures to support the anti-constitutional moves of the group.”
Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors said the group had a military-type structure, with judicial sources naming 101-year-old former army major general Radu Theodoru as a suspect.

Theodoru, a Holocaust denier who has repeatedly praised Romania’s fascist World War Two leadership, said in a recorded interview with his daughter posted on his Facebook page that he believed the current government represented “an anti-Romanian state, a system organized to rob this country.”
“They wasted this country and now they defend themselves and find reasons to misinform the public,” he added. Theodoru did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors said the group had taken steps to negotiate with external forces regarding the potential withdrawal of Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine, from the NATO military alliance.
They said the group aimed to install a new government and dissolve the current constitutional order, introducing a new flag, national anthem and changing the country’s name.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html,"Prosecutors are allowed to keep a wealth of evidence in their case against Bryan Kohberger, the manaccused of killing four University of Idaho studentsin their off-campus home in 2022, a judge has ruled.
The Idaho judge’s decision to deny defense motions relating to the suppression of different types of evidence is among the latest developments ahead of the trial, which is scheduled to begin in August 2025.
It’s been a long and winding road since the four students – Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen – were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school’s main campus in Moscow, Idaho.
Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. He was charged with four counts of murder; anot guilty plea was enteredon his behalf in May 2023, and his attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense.
Theprogression of the casehas been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings that have frustrated the family of one of the victims as well as the judge overseeing the case.
The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys’ access to evidence, particularly how the prosecutionused investigative genetic genealogyin building the case. A second set of hearings concernsKohberger’s proposed alibifor his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to agag order that restrictswhat the parties can publicly say about the case.
Here’s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial developments and decisions so far:
June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of one of the victims came to court tochallenge the gag orderplaced on the parties in the case.
June 23, 2023: Latah County Judge John Judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.”
August 2, 2023: Kohberger’s attorneys said they woulduse an alibi defensebut couldn’t pin down their client’s specific location on the night of the killings because he was “driving during the late night and early morning hours.”
“Mr. Kohberger is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr. Kohberger was at each moment of the hours” of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing.
October 26, 2023: The judgedenied a request to dismissthe grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions.
December 18, 2023: The judgedenied a second motion to dismissthe indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire.
February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view theinvestigative genetic genealogyevidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger.
Related articleA hearing in the Idaho student killings case focuses on genetic genealogy. Here’s why that may be important
Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person’s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing.
The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper.
April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger’s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger’s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client’s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense’s side first.
Judgesaidhe wants a “hearing at least every month,” noting the importance of “cleaning up” the legal proceedings.
April 17, 2024: Kohberger’s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert topartially corroborate his proposed alibithat he was out driving west of Moscow on the night of the slayings.
April 19, 2024:The judgeallowed surveys conductedwith potential jurors to continue “without modification” after temporarily pausing them.
April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the killings.
May 2, 2024: Kohberger’s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnessesbe made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public.
Related article‘This case is turning into a hamster wheel’: Family of slain University of Idaho student frustrated at pace of murder trial
After the hearing, the family of Goncalves, one of the victims,criticized the slow paceof the proceedings. “This case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,” adding they were “incredibly frustrated.”
May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting.
May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case.
Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings.
The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings.
Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger’s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense.
“Because of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I’m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,” he said.
June 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed “defense investigators” to view the material.
June 27, 2024: The partiesset a trial dateof June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing.

“This is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,” he said.
July 22, 2024: Kohberger’s defense team filed a memorandum in support of moving the case out of Latah County, saying he can’t receive a fair trial there “because of the extensive publicity that is ongoing and inflammatory.” The defense suggested the trial be moved to Ada County, which includes Boise, about 300 miles south.
August 13, 2024: Prosecutors objected to the defense team’s change of venue motion, arguing the defense failed to prove that Kohberger would not receive a fair trial in the county. “The Court should deny Defendant’s motion and instead, focus on crafting remedial measures to ensure that a fair and impartial jury can be seated in Latah County,” the prosecution argued.
August 19, 2024: In a reply to the state’s objection, Kohberger’s defense said moving the venue to Ada County is supported by expert analysis, precedent and results of a survey in Latah County showing a “mob mentality.” “The traumatized town of Moscow is understandably filled with deeply held prejudgment opinions of guilt,” the defense wrote.
August 29, 2024: At a hearing on the change of venue request,four expert witnesses testifiedfor the defense about potential biases among the local jury pool. The prosecution did not call any witnesses.
September 5, 2024: Kohberger’s defense team filed 13 motions aimed atremoving the death penaltyfrom his case.
Attorneys argued the death penalty is unconstitutional because it violates international human rights law and prevents the right to a speedy trial. They saidthe methodsused to put inmates to death in Idaho equate to cruel and unusual punishment and the practice violates the public’s evolving standards of decency. Kohberger could be executed by firing squad if he’s sentenced to death – and if the state cannot obtain the drugs necessary for a lethal injection. The court has set October 10 as the deadline for the state’s response.
September 9, 2024: Judge John Judgegranted the defense motionto move the trial out of Latah County due to concerns the local community is prejudiced against him.
“Considering the undisputed evidence presented by the defense, the extreme nature of the news coverage in this case, and the smaller population in Latah County, the defense has met the rather low standard of demonstrating ‘reasonable likelihood’ that prejudicial news coverage will compromise a fair trial in Latah County,” the judge wrote. The judge also highlighted logistical issues with holding such a high-profile case in Latah County.
September 12, 2024:The Idaho Supreme Court ruled tomove Kohberger’s trial to Ada County, which surrounds the capital city of Boise and is the most populous county in the state. Ada County District Judge Steve Hippler will take on the case, the court ruled.
September 26, 2024: The new judge in the case told lawyers he was weighing whether to change the trial date. Hippler would prefer to move the trial – scheduled to start in June – to either May or September, because he anticipated issues with keeping a jury intact during a lengthy summer trial, he told prosecutors and defense attorneys during his first hearing in the case.
The gag order that was issued when the case was in Latah County would remain in place, Hippler also said.
October 9, 2024:Judge Hippler moved Kohberger’s trial date two months later, setting it to begin August 11, 2025. The voir dire portion of the jury selection process will start July 30, 2025, Hippler ordered.
November, 7, 2024:Hippler said heis considering several motions filed by the defense to have the death penalty dismissed in this case. The defense argued the death penalty violates Kohberger’s constitutional rights, which protect him from cruel and unusual punishment, and it violates international law. Kohberger’s attorneys said the death penalty creates a potential conflict with his constitutional rights to effective counsel and a speedy trial, among other concerns.
The court said it will issue written decisions for these motions at an unspecified later date.
November 15, 2024:Kohberger’s defense team filed 13 motions asking to suppress evidence from information obtained through multiple warrants. The information, which includes cell phone records, internet data and searches of his car and parents’ house, has constitutional issues and was obtained through the use ofinvestigative genetic genealogy, his team said. The use of investigative genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger is a longstanding issue in the case.
The defense also requested a hearing to discuss the motions.
November 20, 2024:Judge Hippler allowed prosecutors to continue to pursue the death penalty against Kohberger, denying the defense’s motions on the issue. Defense attorneys in Septemberfiled 13 motionsarguing against the death penalty, saying it would violate Kohberger’s constitutional rights, protecting him from cruel and unusual punishment, and would violate international law, among other concerns.
Hippler addressed the defense’s arguments in his order, saying none of them are strong enough to counter existing case law and precedent.
January 23 and 24, 2025:Duringa motions hearing, Kohberger’s defense team called for the suppression of evidence stemming from the investigative genetic genealogy process, claiming it’s a violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to privacy. They also called for suppression of cell phone recordsfor the same reason.
The defense also requested a Frank’s hearing, which would determine whether law enforcement intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in their original search warrant affidavit. Defense attorney Anne Taylor argued important facts were left out of the affidavit, including that unknown male DNA was found mixed with Kohberger’s DNA on a handrail at the house, and another unknown male DNA sample was found on a glove outside the house. She also noted no DNA found at the crime scene was found in Kohberger’s car or on his steering wheel.
Judge Hippler said the unknown male DNA doesn’t exclude Kohberger, but might indicate someone else was involved. Kohberger’s DNA on the knife sheath alone establishes probable cause for arrest, Hippler said.
The prosecution argued probable cause was established that Kohberger committed crimes and therefore all warrants were valid.
Hippler did not immediately make a decision. If a false statement is found, it means Kohberger’s case could potentially be dismissed.
February 19, 2025:Judge Hippler denied a motion to suppresscritical DNA evidence, allowing the investigative genetic genealogy process to remain in evidence, ruling the defense did not show Kohberger’s constitutional rights were violated.
Multiple motions from Kohberger’s defense team requesting the suppression of information obtained through warrants to AT&T, Google, Amazon and others were also denied, as well as an arrest warrant and several other search warrants, saying that the defense did not meet the standard needed for exclusion.
Hippler also denied a request for a Franks hearing, which would have determined whether law enforcement intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in their original search warrant affidavit. In his order, he said the standards needed for that hearing were not met.
February 21, 2025:New details emergedafter a judge unsealed a partially redacted transcriptfrom a hearing originally closed to the public, giving an inside look at the fight to use investigative genetic genealogy in the case. Judge Hippler ultimately allowed the evidence to be used.
The prosecution filed a motion requesting to use a model of the house where the stabbings occurred during the trial. In a series of filings, the prosecution also asked the judge to bar the admission of certain defenses, including use of an alibi and claiming there was another perpetrator, without sharing evidence first. They also asked that certain expert testimony on Kohberger’s mental health – which is currently sealed and not viewable by the public – not be allowed.
February 24, 2025:Attorneys for Kohberger claim in a motion that their clienthas autism spectrum disorder – or ASD – and executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishment.” A “Motion to Redact or Seal Newly Filed Records” was also entered. The motions mark the latest attempt by Kohberger’s attorneys totry to removethe possibility of the death penalty.
March 3, 2025:Hippler warned attorneys for Kohberger and prosecutors to stop filing so many sealed documents and said the court will “look with scrutiny” at further requests to seal court documents. The judge urged in a court order for both sides to use the “least restrictive method” to protect private information, such as redacting documents rather than sealing them entirely.
March 5, 2025:A motion by the defense is unsealed, revealing a three-person mixture of unknown DNA was found under victim Mogen’s fingernails. The defense asked that the DNA evidence be kept from the jury in Kohberger’s trial because jurors could believe the DNA is Kohberger’s.
March 6, 2025:Text messages between the two surviving roommates in the off-campus home are unsealed, along with the transcript of the 911 call made by the roommates before first responders arrived on scene.
In another defense motion, Kohberger’s attorneys argue that the death penalty should be taken off the table because they cannot possibly review the enormous amount of discovery in time for the August trial.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/europe/macron-france-nuclear-arsenal-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,"Francewill consider extending the protection of its nuclear arsenal to its allies, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday, while warning that Europe needs to be ready for the United States to not “remain by our side” in the Ukraine-Russia war.
“I’ve decided to open the strategic debate on the protection by our deterrence of our allies on the European continent,” he said in a live broadcast on his official social media channels, during which he stressed the need for Europe tocontinue assisting Ukraineand strengthen its own defense.
“Our nuclear deterrence protects us, it is complete, sovereign, French from end to end,” Macron said of France’s nuclear arsenal. “This protects us much more than many of our neighbors.”
“Whatever happens, the decision has always remained and will remain in the hands of the president of the Republic, commander of the military,” Macron added.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Macron of posing a direct threat to Russia with his rhetoric.
“If he considers us a threat, he calls a meeting of the chiefs of general staff of European countries and Britain, says that it is necessary to use nuclear weapons, prepares to use nuclear weapons against Russia, this is, of course, a threat,” Lavrov said at a news conference on Thursday.
Macron also warned that Europe was “entering a new era,” and that it would be “folly” to remain a “spectator” to the threat from Russia.
“The United States, our ally, has changed its position on this war, is less supportive of Ukraine and is casting doubt on what will happen next,” Macron said, adding: “I want to believe that the United States will remain by our side, but we need to be ready if that were not the case.”
Although France remains committed to both NATO and its partnership to the US, it needs to “do more” to strengthen its own “independence in matters of defense and security,” Macron said.
He announced he would invite European leaders to a meeting in Paris next week to work on a plan to deliver a “durable peace,” which may include deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine “once peace has been signed” to prevent Russia from re-invading.
His comments come after Germany’s likely next chancellor,Friedrich Merz,advocated for talks with France and the United Kingdom - Europe’s two nuclear powers - to extend their nuclear protection.
But the current German chancellor Olaf Scholz urged for a “calm and wise approach,” telling reporters in Brussels on Thursday that Europe should not give up on US involvement in nuclear deterrent support.
“We are joined together with each other in NATO. There are very specific rules on this and what is particularly important is what we have in terms of nuclear sharing, which is organized in Germany. I believe that this should not be given up, that is the common view of all central parties in Germany,” Scholz said.
Macron has nodded to the idea before, telling Portuguese TV station RTP last month: “If my [fellow European leaders] want to proceed towards greater autonomy and a capacity for deterrence, well we must open that discussion.”
And on Monday, he told French newspaper Le Parisien, in comments confirmed to CNN by the Elysee Palace, that “Europeans who wish to deepen dialogue with us [on the question of nuclear deterrence] could … be involved with [the French military’s] deterrence exercises.”
The Wednesday speech came days after Macron met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a critical summit, following the disastrous show-down between Zelensky and US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
A small number of nations are working together on a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be presented to the US, Starmer said. Macron revealed more about the plan in an interview with French newspaperLe Figaro, saying that France and the United Kingdom have proposed a month-long limited ceasefire in Ukraine.",europe
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/06/europe/us-world-order-ukraine-zaluzhnyi-intl/index.html,"The US is “destroying” the current world order, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom has said, in unusually blunt comments that come just as Ukraine is trying to patch up ties with the US after the disastrous White House meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump.
Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who wasdismissedas Ukraine’s military chief last year in a major shake up before taking up the diplomatic post and is seen as a possible presidential candidate, also cautioned against the US trying to meet Russia “half way.”
In the wake of the angry exchange in Washington DC, the US halted military aid to Ukraine and paused intelligence sharing, underscoring fears in Kyiv that the Trump administration was swinging behind Russia.
“It’s not just the ‘axis of evil’ and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order,” Zaluzhnyi said, speaking on a panel at British think tank Chatham House on Thursday.
Zaluzhnyi said that the US government had “questioned” the unity of the Western world, with the Trump administration opening talks with Russia, sidelining Ukraine and Europe.
“Now Washington is trying to delegate the security issues to Europe without participation of the US,” he said.
He cast doubt over the future of the NATO military alliance, saying; “We can say that in the near future NATO likewise could stop existing.”
“We see now the White House takes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them half way, so the next target of Russia could be Europe,” he added.
His words come as Europe has been scrambling to sure up its defense capabilities after Donald Trump’s dramatic reversal of US policies sparked fears that Europe may not be able to rely on American support amid the ever-present threat from Russia.
Ukraine’s European allies have rallied around Zelensky following theshowdownbetween him and Trump in the Oval Office, which culminated in the Ukrainian leader being thrown out of the White House.
Since then, Zelensky has sought to ease tensions with the Trump administration, saying that the fiery meeting “did not go the way it was supposed to,” describing it as “regrettable” and noting that Ukraine is ready to negotiate about an end to the conflict.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/style/lady-jane-grey-portrait-england-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,"Lady Jane Grey, a teenage pawn in the power struggles that plagued theTudorcourt, ruled England for just nine days and was later executed for treason. Now, researchers believe they may have identified the only known portrait of the so-called “Nine Days Queen” painted before her death.
Following the death of Edward VI in 1553, unscrupulous politicians propelled the staunchly Protestant young girl to the throne in a bid to prevent her Roman Catholic relative, Mary Tudor, from becoming Queen.
The mysterious portrait, on loan to conservation charity English Heritage from a private collection, shows a young woman clad modestly in a white cap and shawl.
According to English Heritage, it was acquired by Anthony Grey, 11th Earl of Kent, in 1701, as an image of Lady Jane Grey. It remained “the defining image” of England’s shortest reigning monarch until 21st-century art historians questioned its attribution and rejected its identity.
In an attempt to settle the question, English Heritage worked alongside London’s Courtauld Institute of Art and dendrochronologist Ian Tyers to conduct a technical analysis of the piece, its senior collections conservator, Rachel Turnbull, said in a statement published Friday.
A dendrochronological analysis—a scientific method of dating tree rings—of the painting’s panel suggests it was probably used for the artwork between 1539 and around 1571, according to the statement.
The panel, which is made of two Baltic oak boards from two different trees, has a merchant or cargo mark on its back that resembles a mark on a portrait of King Edward VI, Jane’s predecessor on the throne.
Scans using infrared reflectography show significant changes were made to the woman’s outfit and face after the completion of the initial portrait, English Heritage said.
The white scarf around her shoulders is believed to be a later addition.
Bands encircling her right arm under the scarf are thought to be possibly part of a larger decorated sleeve that is now hidden, or a now-gone scarf that was previously draped over her lower arms, like the outfits she is depicted as wearing in portraits painted after her death.

The linen cap, or coif, covering her hair also appears significantly altered. A coif with a different shape and potentially even a hood, which is a fancier headpiece worn over a coif, can be seen around her face in the scans. The researchers suggested a veil may even have been present at one point before being painted out.
The woman’s eyes now look to the left, but they were previously looking right, English Heritage said.
In addition to the repainted areas, the subject’s eyes, mouth and ears have been scratched out, defacing the artwork for what were probably religious or political reasons, the organization said. It noted that a posthumous depiction of Lady Jane Grey in London’s National Portrait Gallery shows similar marks.
The changes to the painting may have been made in order to tone it down and present the subject as a demure Protestant martyr, it added.
“While we can’t confirm that this is definitely Lady Jane Grey, our results certainly make a compelling argument!” said Turnbull.
“From the newly discovered evidence of a once perhaps more elaborate costume and the dating of the wooden panel from within her lifetime, to the deliberate scratching of her eyes, it is possible that we are looking at the shadows of a once more royal portrait of Lady Jane Grey, toned down into subdued, Protestant martyrdom after her death. Regardless of her identity, the results of our research have been fascinating,” she added.

“This is such an interesting picture posing so many questions, and if this is Jane Grey, a valuable addition to the portraiture of this young heroine, as a woman of character—a powerful challenge to the traditional representation of her as a blindfolded victim,” bestselling historical novelist Philippa Gregory said in the release.
Jane spent a lot of time at the royal court after her father was made Duke of Suffolk in October 1551.
Her Protestantism made her a candidate for the throne for those who supported the English Reformation, like the powerful Duke of Northumberland, who married her to his son and persuaded a dying King Edward to make her his successor.
Edward died on July 6, 1553, and Jane, who had fainted when first presented with the idea of becoming Queen, ascended the throne four days later.
However, by July 19, she relinquished her crown to Edward’s sister, Mary Tudor, who had the support of the populace, and who was meant to be the heir, according to both the law and Henry VIII’s will.
Jane was subsequently charged with high treason, to which she pleaded guilty, and was beheaded on February 12, 1554. She was 16 years old.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/china/china-wang-yi-press-conference-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,"If every country were to put itself first, the ‘law of the jungle’ would return, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in response to a question from CNN’s Steven Jiang about US President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy.
“There are more than 190 countries in the world,” the Chinese diplomat said during a news conference in Beijing.
“Should everyone stress ‘my country first’ and obsess over a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign again, smaller and weaker countries would bear the brunt first, and international norms and order would take a body blow,” he added.
Wang, China’s most seasoned diplomat and a trusted hand for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, made the remarks while hosting his 11th such news briefing on the sidelines of theyearly “two sessions” gatheringof China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body.
The highly choregraphed event is typically a chance for Beijing to broadcast its views on pressing global issues. But this year’s gathering, which comes as Beijing iswading into a new trade warwith Washington and Trump upends US foreign policy, gave Wang a well-timed platform to present China as a reliable leader and stable partner.
When asked about Trump’s decision todouble additional tariffs on Chinese importsto the US earlier this week, Wang struck a defiant tone: “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China on the one hand and develop good relations with China on the other.”
“This ‘two-faced’ approach is not only not conducive to the stability of bilateral relations, but also unable to establish mutual trust,” he added.

“A big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,” Wang said, adding that China “resolutely opposes power politics and hegemony.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has upended the US role on the global stage: pulling back from international pacts and bodies,cancelling much of America’s vast foreign aidand threatening totake controlof other countries’ sovereign territory. His administration has also thrown into question longstanding alliances, alienating Europe as it pivots to Russia — and earlier this weeksuspending American military aid to Ukraine.
Frequent criticisms of China’s aggression in South China Sea and its intimidation of the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan notwithstanding, Chinese diplomats have used the American president’s shakeup to inject more oomph into efforts to showcase their country — and not America — as being on the right side of history.
Few global issues have lent themselves as neatly to that rhetoric than the war in Ukraine.
Washington’s pivot toward Moscow has not only shocked European allies but left open an opportunity for Beijing to push back against longstanding criticism of its close ties with Moscow, which haveonly expanded since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking to media Wednesday on the margins of a meeting of China’s advisory body the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Lu Shaye, China’s special envoy for the European Affairs, called on countries to “first criticize the US” and not China for Russia ties.
“Is it still necessary to question whether China is favoring Russia? If they still have doubts about this, they should first criticize the US. The US is not just leaning (towards Russia) — it’s supporting it,” said Lu, a former ambassador to France who’s known for his brash style.
“European friends should reflect on how the Trump administration’s policies contrast with those of the Chinese government,” he said, adding that with its “mutually beneficial” approach to foreign policy, China’s “circle of friends will only grow.”
The Chinese foreign minister also addressed the war in Ukraine and Russia-China relations during his roughly 90-minute press conference.

He hailed Moscow-Beijing ties as a “constant push in a turbulent world” at a time when Trump officials have suggested they hope to drive awedge between the two close partners.
When asked how Beijing could factor into efforts toward peace in Ukraine, which so far have appeared to be largely driven by Washington and Moscow and bypassing Europe and Ukraine, Wang reiterated China’s claim that it holds an “objective and impartial” stance on the conflict and said it “welcomes and supports all efforts for peace.”
But he also used his answer to promote a shared view between Moscow and Beijing — who have long been united in their opposition to NATO, which they have falsely blamed for sparking Russia’s invasion. `
“All parties should learn something from the crisis,” Wang said, adding in a veiled reference to the US and its Europe alliance system: “No country should build its security on the insecurity of another.”
He also indirectly criticized Washington’s approach to the conflict in Gaza, when asked about Trump’s controversial proposal last month for the US to take ownership of the war-torn enclave and redevelop it into a “Middle Eastern Riviera.”
“If the major country truly cares about the people in Gaza, it should promote comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, ramp up humanitarian assistance, observe the principle of Palestinians governing Palestine and contribute to the reconstruction,” he said.

Tusk told the country’s Sejm, the lower house of parliament, that the military training would create a reserve force that is “adequate to possible threats.”
The speech was focused on the international security situation. Poland is located along NATO’s eastern flank and is deeply concerned by the war in Ukraine. There are fears that if Ukraine is defeated, Russia will turn its imperial ambitions next to countries like Poland, which it controlled during the 19th century and during the Cold War.
Jaroslaw Kaczyński, the head of Poland’s largest opposition party, the conservative Law and Justice, said a mental shift in society would also be needed in addition to the military training of men. “We will have a return to the chivalric ethos and to the fact that men should also be soldiers, that is, be able to expose themselves, even to death,” Kaczyński said.

Concern has grown in Poland and across most of Europe as President Donald Trump has shifted the US position from being a defender of Ukraine to withholding military aid and intelligence and signalling a support for Russia’s position.
“If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice, or capitulation in such a way that weakens its sovereignty and makes it easier for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to gain control over Ukraine, then, without a doubt — and we can all agree on that — Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,” Tusk said.
President Andrzej Duda on Friday said he submitting an amendment to the Polish constitution for consideration which would oblige the country to spend at least 4% of its GDP each year on defense.
Poland is already NATO’s top spender on defense as a percentage of its overall economy, spending above 4% of its GDP this year. But Duda said he wanted to take advantage of the consensus on the political scene in Poland today on the matter to enshrine it in the highest law.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/nato-ukraine-survive-without-united-states-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"Europe is staring down the barrel of a stark new reality where the United States being the backbone of NATO – the alliance that has guaranteed the continent’s security for almost 80 years – is no longer a given.
President Donald Trump’spublic animositytowards Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, hiswillingness to embrace Russia’s Vladimir Putinand recent comments casting doubt over whether he would defend NATO allies “if they don’t pay” have all forced European leaders to start thinking the previously unthinkable - is the US a reliable security partner at a time when the continent is being rocked by its biggest war since the 1940s?
But NATO without the US is far from impotent, with more than a million troops and modern weaponry at its disposal from the 31 other countries in the alliance. It also has the wealth and technological knowhow to defend itself without the US, analysts say.
The US and Germany are the biggest contributors to NATO’s military budget, civil budget and security investment program, at almost 16% each, followed by the UK at 11% and France at 10%, a NATO fact sheet says. Analysts say it wouldn’t take much for Europe to make up for the loss of Washington’s contribution.
If European countries unite and buy the right equipment, Europe “could pose a serious conventional and … nuclear deterrent” to Russia, Ben Schreer, Europe executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said in a Zoom call with CNN and other journalists in late February.
“Europe alone (still has) a capacity to muster the resources it would need to defend itself, it’s just a question of whether (it is) willing to,” Schreer said.
And that’s the key question. Over more than 75 years and the administrations of 14 different US presidents, including the first Trump administration, the US has been the sinew that has kept the alliance together.

During the Cold War, US troops on the continent were there as a deterrent to any Soviet ambitions to expand the Warsaw Pact alliance and eventually saw out its end when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. NATO campaigns in the Balkans in the 1990s were conducted with US troops and airpower. And, until the second Trump administration took office on January 20, Washington spearheaded aid for Ukraine.
Those decades of trans-Atlantic solidarity may have come to an end in recent days, analysts say.
Trump’s Oval Office blow-up with Zelensky - after which he haltedUS aid to Kyiv- “felt like a deeper rupture, not just with Ukraine, but with the US ‘free world’ strategy from Truman through Reagan,” Dan Fried, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former US assistant secretary of state for Europe, said on the council’s website.
John Lough, a former NATO official who is now an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London, sees an even more profound split in the alliance.
“It simply feels that the United States sees Europe more as a competitor, a rival, than an ally,” Lough told CNN, adding that because of that the commitment for Washington to defend NATO allies is somewhat in doubt.
It’s a fracture that Lough sees as unrepairable.
“Once you start to lose part of that commitment, you effectively lose it all,” Lough said.
Some people in European circles are starting to ask whether Washington should be described “in some ways as an enemy,” he said.
But some analysts say a NATO without the US is not a bad idea.
“As soon as US allies become convinced that they can no longer trust in US capabilities to defend them when push comes to shove,they will rush to pick up the slack and work towards growing their own capabilities,” Moritz Graefrath,a postdoctoral fellow in security and foreign policy at William & Mary’s Global Research Institute, wrote in War on the Rocks last year.
“It is in this sense that — perhaps counterintuitively — a withdrawal of US forces will create an even stronger, not weaker, Europe,” Graefrath wrote.
Prime Minister of NATO member Poland, Donald Tusk, thinks this process has started already.
“Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia - we are simply stronger,” he said ahead of a European Union summit this week. “We just had to start believing in it. And today it seems to be happening.”
In concept, a European military could be formidable.
Turkey has NATO’s largest armed forces after the United States, with 355,200 active military personnel, according to the Military Balance 2025, compiled by the IISS.

In contrast, there were about 80,000 US troops assigned or deployed to bases in NATO countries as of June 2024, a July 2024 report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) says.
Most of those US troops are in Germany (35,000), Italy (12,000) and the UK (10,000), the CRS says.
Some of the larger NATO nations also have weapons equal to or many times better than what Russia has.
Take aircraft carriers for instance. While Russia has a single, antiquated aircraft carrier, the UK alone has two modern carriers capable of launching F-35B stealth fighters. France, Italy and Spain field aircraft carriers or amphibious ships capable of launching fighter jets, according to the Military Balance.
Aside from the US, France and the UK maintain nuclear forces, with both deploying ballistic missile submarines.

The NATO allies besides the US have about 2,000 fighter and ground-attack jets among them, with dozens of new F-35 stealth jets included in that number.
Ground forces include modern tanks, including German Leopards and British Challengers, donated units of which are now serving in the Ukrainian military. European NATO countries can field powerful cruise missiles, like the jointFranco-British SCALP/Storm Shadow, which has also proven itself on the Ukrainian battlefield.
The Military Balance 2025 report notes that Europe is taking steps to improve its military forces without US help. In 2024, six European countries united in a project to develop ground-launched cruise missiles, made moves to increase munitions production capacity and to diversify their supplier base, looking to countries like Brazil, Israel and South Korea as new sources for military hardware.
Analysts say even if the US were to completely pull out of Europe, it would leave important infrastructure behind.
The US has 31 permanent bases in Europe, according to the Congressional Research Service - naval, air, ground and command-and-control facilities that would be available to the countries where they are located if the US were to leave.
And Graefrath notes, that infrastructure would not be lost to Washington if there is regret after a possible US withdrawal.
“It leaves much of the US military infrastructure intact for an extended period (ensuring) that the United States retains the ability to make a military return if Europe were to fail to respond as predicted,” he wrote.
Some hope that the talk of a US withdrawal from NATO is just Trump bluster aimed at pushing allies to cough up and spend more on defense.
They say the world, and another key US alliance, have been here before – during Trump’s first administration, when hereportedly asked the Pentagonto look at options for drawing down US troops stationed in South Korea as protection against nuclear-armed North Korea.
That came as Trump prepared for meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at which he hoped to persuade Kim to commit to giving up his nuclear arsenal.
A source close to the White House told CNN at the time that a US troop pullout was viewed as something that could possibly happen in the future but “not until long after (North Korea’s) nukes are verifiably gone.”

But Kim rejected all entreaties for him to give up his nuclear weapons program.
The Trump-Kim meeting “was sold as a big success despite that fact that it wasn’t,” said Schreer.
Afterward, the US returned to “business as usual” on the Korean Peninsula, Schreer said. The US – with tens of thousands of troops in South Korea – kept them there. Bilateral exercises with Seoul’s forces resumed, US warships visited South Korean ports and US Air Force bombers flew over the region.
The same could occur in Europe if Trump doesn’t get what he wants from Putin, analysts said. NATO could go on, with the recent threats to depart just a small bump in the road.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/03/europe/mannheim-germany-car-ramming-intl/index.html,"German authorities say a car-ramming incident in the southwestern city of Mannheim that killed two people Monday was a deliberate attack but it does not appear to have been politically or religiously motivated.
Police said Monday night the two dead were an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man. Eleven others were injured.
The attacker purposefully targeted and struck people at high speed, police said at a press conference, noting that authorities originally thought they were responding to a traffic accident.
Public prosecutor Romeo Schüssler said there was “concrete evidence” that the suspected attacker suffers from a psychological illness. Police searched the suspect’s house Monday, the prosecutor added.
Mannheim police said they had arrested the suspect after launching a large-scale manhunt in the city center shortly after midday local time (6 a.m. ET).
The suspect is a 40-year-old German national from the neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate state, police said.
“We are all deeply shocked by this heinous inhumane attack on peaceful people,” said Christian Specht, mayor of Mannheim in a statement posted on the city website. “Our thoughts are with the dead and injured, their families and friends.”
Mikla Cela, a worker at a restaurant in the city center, told CNN that he saw a black car drive by at high speed. He said he later heard several people screaming and saw a man with a white jacket lying on the floor.
Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and likely Germany’s next chancellor, said he was “shocked” by Monday’s incident, as well as several other “terrible acts” that have rocked the country in recent months.
“Germany must become a safe country again. We will work towards this with the utmost determination,” Merz said.
Mannheim University Hospital said that three of the injured people it has received are receiving urgent acute care, including a child.
Ferry Overdevest, the owner of a flower store in central Mannheim, told CNN that around 30 people had sought shelter in his shop and that ambulances were on the streets outside.

Germany has been rocked by a string of deadly car ramming attacks in recent months.
In December, a vehicle plowed into a Christmas market inMagdeburg, killing six people, including a 9-year-old boy. The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who had lived in Germany for more than a decade and worked to help Saudis leave his home country. Social media posts showed he was a fervent critic of Islam.
In February, a person drove a Mini Cooper into demonstrators inMunich, killing a mother and her child and injuring more than 30 others. The suspect is a 24-year-old Afghan man.
That attack came on the eve of the Munich Security Conference and just days before the country’s federal election, where concerns over immigration and security helped propel the far-rightAlternative for Germany(AfD) party to second place.
Monday’s incident comes as Germany celebrates “Rose Monday,” a carnival held before Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent.
German police were already on high alert ahead of the carnival celebrations, but the incident in Mannheim has prompted some forces to take additional measures. Police in Ulm, a city southeast of Mannheim, said they have “noticeably increased” their presence around carnival events.",europe

McDonald’s has cut breakfast service timings by 90 minutes, the company said, after a shortage of eggs caused by bird flu outbreaks that have led to the slaughter of about 1.5 million chickens.
“Like many retailers, we are carefully managing supply of eggs due to current industry challenges,” McDonald’s said on Facebook, adding that from Tuesday it would stop serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m. instead of the usual time of midday.
“We are working hard with our Aussie farmers and suppliers to return this back to normal as soon as possible,” the fast food company said.
Australia is battling outbreaks of several strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza that have struck 11 poultry facilities, most of them egg farms, in its southeast since May.
None of the strains are the H5N1 variant of bird flu that hasspreadthrough bird and mammal populations worldwide, infecting billions of animals and a small number ofhumans.
Fewer than 10% of Australia’s egg-laying hens have been affected and authorities say they are successfully containing the virus, but several retailers have set limits on the number of eggs customers may buy.
There has been some disruption to egg supply, with shelves in some stores emptying toward the end of the day, Rowan McMonnies, the managing director of industry body Australian Eggs, said last week.
“Consumers can be assured there’s still over 20 million hens under the care of hundreds of egg farmers across Australia that will continue to work hard to ensure there’s eggs on shelves,” he added.

“Everyone feels pain at the anger,” Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson told CNN’s Richard Quest in an exclusive interview at an airline industry conference in Dubai Monday. “It’s not just me; (it’s) 25,000 people that work for us as well. Because not only (did) we let our customers down, we let our people down.”
Last August, Australian regulators accused Qantas in a lawsuit of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that the airline had already canceled — affecting more than 86,000 customers.
Qantasagreedlast month to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) to settle the lawsuit. Of that, about 20 million Australian dollars ($13.3 million) will go to the affected customers.
The remaining 100 million Australian dollars ($66.5 million) is a fine — the biggest ever for an Australian airline, according toReuters.
Hudson, who took the helm at Qantas in September, soon after the lawsuit was filed, told Quest the airline is focused on repairing its relationships with passengers and staff.
She has “spent a lot of time listening” to the concerns of customers and staff, she said. The airline is investing in improving the in-flight experience, including the food it serves and the Wi-Fi service it offers.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk/index.html,"Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China.
The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum.
Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5.
“Investigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,” police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time.
Among the artefacts attacked was Loong – described by the museum as the “oldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.”
“Loong” is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture – usually translated as dragon in English – and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals.
Dragon danceshave been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets.
Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town’s residents.
Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called “Dai Gum San” - or “Big Gold Mountain,” according to Bendigo Tourism.
To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital.
The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 “to document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia” according to the museum’s website.
Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired.
Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong’s nose.
Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon’s tongue.
Other parts of the museum were also targeted.
Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip.
Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said.
“With these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,” he said.
The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act “may have been racially motivated.”",australia

Peake clinched his ticket to Royal Portrush after capturing the 104th New Zealand Open, sinking an 8-foot par putt on the final hole to avoid a four-way playoff.
Entering the final round, trailing four strokes behind leader Guntaek Koh, Peake delivered a bogey-free 66 to finish at 23-under-par, claiming the title and the approximately $112,000 prize.
“I’ve just changed my life,” Peake said after his win. “This is what I do. I just want to be here and play golf. The story is what it is. But I’m just out here playing golf.”
At 21, Peake was a promising junior golfer from Western Australia, playing alongside the likes of Cameron Smith. However, his career was derailed when he became involved with the outlawed Rebels motorcycle gang. A conviction for assault led to a five-year prison sentence.
While incarcerated, Peake was contacted by renowned golf coach Ritchie Smith, who saw potential in the Aussie golfer and helped him resume his career upon release.
Peake returned to full-time golf in 2022 and earned a card on the PGA Tour of Australasia in 2024. Now a rookie on the tour, the 31-year-old had difficulty getting into New Zealand, nearly missing the tournament due to a delay by immigration officials because of his criminal record.
However, Peake was able to resolve his visa issues and arrived at Millbrook Resort course near Queenstown on Tuesday ahead of the tournament’s opening round on Thursday.
Reflecting on his journey, Peaked showed immense gratitude for the support from his family and friends, and his own confidence in overcoming past challenges.
“I always knew I could do it but it was just a matter of when I was going to do it,” Peake said. “Along with my family and my team everyone believed and most of all I believed as well.”
With his victory, Peake will have a chance to raise the Claret Jug in July and moves closer to securing a card on the DP World Tour.",australia

Max makes an unlikely conservation worker, and not just because he’s a dog.
He’s also bred for hunting. But instead, the English Springer Spaniel is using his supercharged sense of smell to sniff out koala scat in a bid to help save the iconic Australian animal.
Koalas are native to Australia and in 2022 the government listed them as endangered on most of the country’s east coast. By some estimates, their numbers have halved in the last 20 years, due toa number of threatsincluding habitat reduction, disease, drought and fires.
When Max discovers koala droppings, he lays down with the find between his front paws and nudges at it with his nose, says Jack Nesbitt, of Canines for Wildlife, which trains dogs for conservation-related tasks. Max is rewarded with his favorite treat – a tennis ball.
The scat provides a trove of valuable information. Analysis in the lab can tell ecologists if the koala has diseases like chlamydia, which can cause blindness and infertility, and is now common among koalas.
Genetic analysis can also show how a koala is related to others around it, and how it’s moving through a habitat. “We’re able to identify individual koalas from their poos,” says Nesbitt, who founded Canines for Wildlife with his parents.
In late 2024, Max identifieda new group of koalasinland of Coffs Harbor, a coastal city between Sydney and Brisbane, which, significantly, appeared to be chlamydia free.
The biggest threat to koalas is the destruction of habitat by clearing land for agriculture, housing, mining and forestry, according to the findings of a parliamentary inquiryreleased in 2020. It also said that without “urgent government intervention” koalas will go extinct before 2050 in New South Wales, and that a government estimate that 36,000 koalas remain in New South Wales is “outdated and unreliable.”
Land clearing can reduce food sources for koalas, who arepicky eaterssurviving mainly onpoisonouseucalypt species, which they have adapted to digest, andoccasionallyother related plants. Habitat loss can also isolate a koala from potential mates, and crossing roads or the backyards of homes exposes them to risks like vehicles and pet dogs.
Climate change poses another threat, not least from the increased risk of wildfires. At least 5,000 koalas were killed in New South Wales by bushfires in the 2019 to 2020 season, according to the parliamentary inquiry.
The government has committed tens of millions of dollars to create a 315,000-hectare Great Koala National Park. According to conservationists,logging continueswithin its proposed boundaries. A spokesperson for the New South Wales government told CNN that while work to establish the park is carried out, the government has directed forestry operations to stop in areas being assessed for the park which are hubs for “critical multi-generational resident koalas and their habitats.”
Canines for Wildlife doesn’t engage in advocacy, but it says some groups use its data to show the usage and importance of areas at risk of logging, in the hopes of influencing the state government’s decision around what forest will be protected.
Nesbitt says that groups like city councils use Canines for Wildlife’s data when making planning decisions; the organization is now working on another project in a different area of Coffs Harbor, which has one of the largest koala populationsin New South Wales.
“Finding those areas of habitat that are the most important for protection, and being able to identify that with evidence, is probably the most important impact they could have,” says Nesbitt, of the dogs.
Stuart Blanch, of WWF-Australia, tells CNN that koala detection methods have evolved in recent decades to get a more accurate estimate of koala occupancy in an area. Once, conservationists relied on methods like listening for koalas – they make loud bellowing and growling noises – or using a spotlight at night to spot shining eyes.
Today, methods like drone monitoring and using dogs for scat detection have become more popular, though those options are more expensive.
Dogs detecting scat have some benefits overdrones,he adds. They can detect the presence of a koala after it has moved on, and in places with thick foliage that drones might not be able to see into.
Canines for Wildlife dogs have done work with other species, like theendangeredHastings River mouse, and the organization is currently training dogs to detect the Kroombit Tinker frog, which iscritically endangered.
Although dogs might not seem like natural conservationists, Nesbitt says they’re the perfect tool to have in an ecologist’s toolkit. He adds: “Their ability to see the world through their nose, is a sensor that we just don’t have access to in any other way.”",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/china-lifts-ban-australia-beef-exporters-intl-hnk/index.html,"China has lifted bans on imports from five major Australian beef processing facilities, the Australian government said on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving relations between the two nations.
Beijing has now removed restrictions from eight abattoirs but two remain subject to import bans, the government said.
Chinaimposed the bansbetween 2020 and 2022, around the same time it barred imports of a swathe of commodities including coal, timber andwine from Australiaafter Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19.
The bans applied to certain abattoirs but did not affect others, which meant Australia was still able to ship beef to China.
“It was difficult for those particular abattoirs but we still saw beef flowing,” said Matt Dalgleish, an analyst at agricultural consultants Episode 3.
He said the removal of the restrictions should still boost Australian shipments to China, which have already risen to their highest level since 2020 as a shrinking cattle herd in the United States, Australia’s main competitor, reduces US exports.
Lower US supply may have been one reason for China’s action, Dalgleish said.
China was Australia’s second-biggest beef export market last year, receiving 240,000 tons worth around $1.6 billion, Australian trade data shows.
Beijing has lifted most of the barriers it imposed on Australian goodssince a change of government in Canberra two years ago. A ban on imports of Australian lobsters remains in place.
“We continue to press China to remove the remaining trade impediments, including for Australia’s rock lobster industry,” Australian foreign minister Penny Wong, trade minister Don Farrell and agriculture minister Murray Watt said in a joint statement.
They said China’s trade impediments at their height impacted Australian exports worth 20.6 billion Australian dollars ($13.6 billion).
The reasons China gave for suspending the Australian beef processors were issues over labeling or contamination or cases of COVID-19 among their workers.",australia

The exercises, which camewithout formal notice, have caused deep consternation in both nations. Suddenly, thespecter of China’s military power was no longer confinedto the distant waters of the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait – where China’s territorial aggression has escalated under leader Xi Jinping – but a stark reality unfolding much closer to home.
At the same time, Chinese warships have been sighted near Vietnam andTaiwan, part of a show of Chinese naval strength in the Pacific region that regularly rattles US allies.
China was unapologetic and insisted it complied with international law, withstate media suggestingWestern countries should get used to Chinese warships in nearby waters.
In the past, Washington’s partners have found comfort in their firm ties with the US, but that was before Donald Trump’sexplosive meetingwith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the US leader’s subsequent order tohalt aid to Ukraineas it battles Russia’s invasion.
The bust-up in the Oval Office served to sharpen anxieties in capitals across the Pacific: If the US is willing to turn its back on Ukraine – effectively rewarding Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Europe – would it do the same in Asia when faced with a belligerent Beijing?
Trump’sembrace of Russiaand hiscold shoulder to Europe– driven by a transactional approach that Singapore’s defense minister likened to a “landlord seeking rent” – has heightened trepidation in the Indo-Pacific region, where many nations look to the US to keep Chinese aggression in check.
“It does raise issues as to whether the US will be committed to regional security. And even if the US remains committed, what will the Trump administration ask in return?” said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
Experts say it’s a fair question from allies who’ve long relied on the US to provide security assurances, enabling them to limit their own defense spending.
Now might be the time, they add, for American partners, like Australia and New Zealand, to reexamine budgets and tighten regional alliances with other countries that could find themselves exposed as Trump pursues his “America first” mantra.
Australia has made sure the world is aware of China’s movements in international waters in the South Pacific, issuing daily location updates from trailing Australian Navy ships and spy planes.
Defense Minister Richard Marles said the data would be analyzed to determine exactly what China was doing – and what message it was intending to send.
China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian,maintainedthat China posed no threat to Australia while signaling that more warship visits should be expected. “As a major power in this region…it is normal for China to send their vessels to different parts of the region to conduct various kinds of activities,” Xiaotold Australia’s public broadcaster the ABC.
Across the Pacific in Washington, Trump was sending his own message to US partners in Europe that they needed to step up military spending in defense of Ukraine.
Before his fractious meeting with Zelensky, Trump had intended to sign a mineral resources deal with the Ukrainian leader so that the US could recoup some of the cost of its aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. But the signing ceremony was abandoned, with Trump telling Zelensky on his social platform Truth Social to “come back when he is ready for Peace.”
By subsequently cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump was seeking to force rich European nations to shoulder more of the load, say experts.
“He believes they have all been free riding off the United States for half a century,” said Peter Dean, the director of foreign policy and defense at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.
The move seemed to reap rewards when on Tuesday theEuropean Union unveiled a plan to allow member states to borrow€150 billion ($158 billion) to boost their defense spending and “massively step up” their military support for Kyiv.
Dean says Trump wants a deal for peace in Ukraine; however, he’s ignoring Zelensky’s concerns about the longevity of that peace without measures to keep Putin in check.
“It seems to be that (Trump) almost wants peace at any price, rather than a peace that is fair and equitable, or a peace that you keep,” he said. “The question is, what does the deal look like? And that’s what everyone’s worried about. How much is he willing to trade away?”
As Trump upends the transatlantic alliance – a pillar of Western security for decades – his administration has signaled that the US should wrap up conflicts elsewhere to focus on deterring China in the Pacific.
The urgency of that aim was highlighted by China’s latest flexing of its military muscle.
“It’s a test of resolve, for sure,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at RSIS in Singapore, of China’s military drills. “China (is) carving out a sphere of influence in the Pacific to test to see if countries in the region are going to resist it.”
Even before Trump’s clash with Zelensky, the presence of Chinese warships on its southern coast had turned Australia’s attention to AUKUS, its multibillion-dollar security deal with the US and the United Kingdom.
Concerns had flared about whether the deal could withstand the whims of Trump’s White House when a British reporter asked the US president if he and his UK counterpart had spoken about AUKUS.
“What does that mean?” Trump replied. The incident was later brushed off byTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent as an issue of accents.“I think we’re going to have to limit the questions to Americans he can understand,” he said.
Dean, from the University of Sydney, said it’s no bad thing that Trump wasn’t across the acronym because the deal already has the fulsome support of his closest advisers.
That support was cemented by Australia’s first down payment of $500 million to bolster America’s submarine production, with the agreement that some nuclear-powered subs will be sold to Australia to boost its military capability in the Indo-Pacific.
It’s the kind of deal Trump will want to focus on in the future, Dean said.
“He’s looking to make money for the United States, and he’s looking to do better deals. And AUKUS is a bit of an exemplar deal for them,” Dean said.
“For the Europeans, I wouldn’t underestimate Donald Trump looking at this and going, if the Australians can do this, why can’t you?”
Elsewhere across the Pacific, US allies appeared unsettled by the extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba struck a cautious tone on Monday, insisting he had “no intention of taking sides” when asked about the Trump-Zelensky clash.
Yet, he vowed to do his utmost to “maintain US involvement and promote unity” among the Group of Seven nations – hinting at growing disquiet over the fracturing of the Western alliance.
“Today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s East Asia,” he added. “We must also consider steadily increasing our deterrent power to prevent war.”
Japan, which has territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea, has raised concern about increasing Chinese military maneuvers in its nearby waters. Last year, a Chinese aircraft carrier entered Japan’s contiguous watersfor the first time.
South Korea, another US ally in East Asia, declined to comment on the meeting between Trump and Zelensky but said it was closely monitoring US suspension of military aid to Ukraine.
Trump has repeatedly called on allies like South Korea to pay more for US troops stationed on their territory. In a speech to Congress on Wednesday, he once again made a veiled threat while referencing what he called unfair tariffs South Korea places on US goods – something Seoul denies.
“We give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that’s what happened, this is happening by friend and foe,” Trump said.
In Taiwan, the self-governing democracy China has vowed to one day absorb, Defense Minister Wellington Koo tried to reassure confidence despite what he described as “rapid and bizarre changes” in the international landscape.
“I think the United States won’t retreat from the Indo-Pacific region, because this is its core interests,” he told reporters in a briefing Tuesday, citing shared interests with Washington in economic development, geopolitics and US military security.
But Koo also nodded to Trump’s “America first” stance. “In international politics, we also deeply realize that we can’t just talk about values and not talk about interests. Of course, the United States must value its own national interests,” he added.
Experts say the US has become frustrated at having to shoulder the weight of other countries who fail to contribute to their own defense.
“The Trump administration has made clear its lack of tolerance. It’s had no tolerance for free riders,” said Thompson, from RSIS in Singapore.
“I think the countries that get that message clearest and fastest are the ones that are going to be the good partners of the United States, because it’s not like the US is abandoning allies. What the US is doing is prioritizing its most capable ones,” Thompson said.

However, hundreds of thousands of homes in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales were without power on Sunday, due to fallen trees and downed powerlines, and authorities warned that flooding remained a serious risk.
“The situation … remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds, heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts, and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Sunday.
A body believed to be that of a 61-year-old man who was swept into floodwaters Friday afternoon near the town of Dorrigo in NSW was located on Saturday after a wide-scale search, NSW Police said.
Images showed severe erosion along some of the area’s most popular tourist beaches. On the Gold Coast, the sea had carved 4- to 6-meter (13- to 19-foot) cliffs into the sand, undermining the foundations of beachside platforms.
Alfred was the most southerly cyclone to threaten the region since Tropical Cyclone Zoe in 1974. The storm’s current strength is equivalent to a tropical depression in the Atlantic basin but its demotion to a tropical low will not alter its overall impact.
Alfred had initially been expected to hit on Thursday night, then Friday morning, and the extra delay raised anxiety levels among residents in an area where cyclones are rare.
By late Friday, the region was ready for the worst Alfred could offer, but over the weekend rain looked set to pose the biggest challenge.
Several flood warnings remain in place for south-east Queensland, and on Sunday morning Hervey Bay, near K’Gari, the World Heritage-listed island off the coast, recorded 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain in just two hours.
Major rivers in the Northern Rivers region of NSW were also at risk of flooding. Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel, state emergency services and police were pre-positioned in the area before the cyclone’s arrival to ensure a quick response.
Late Saturday, 13 ADF personnel were injured – six seriously – in an accident involving two military trucks near Lismore. One vehicle left the road and rolled several times, while the other tipped on its side while trying to avoid it, according to NSW Police. Each truck carried 15 passengers and a driver.
Defence Minister Richard Marles said Sunday the officers had been clearing roads of storm debris and were in transit when the incident occurred.
The delay in Alfred’s arrival gave homeowners more time to prepare but also allowed sightseers to view its effects on the coast – including surfers who earlier this week braved waves that by Friday were too dangerous to surf.
Stuart Nettle, the editor of Swellnet, a forecaster service that operates 100 cameras near the coast, said Alfred had produced waves that will be talked about for years.
“The fourth and fifth of March are going to live on in infamy in the memory of Gold Coast surfers,” he said. “Tropical Cyclone Alfred just sat there at the optimum distance and the optimum direction from the Gold Coast and delivered two days of exceptional waves. There’ll be surfers talking about it for a long time to come.”
Few dared to enter the water Friday as waves lashed the coast, prompting warnings from authorities of fines of $10,000 (16,000 Australian dollars) for risky behavior.
Police had stern words for one teenager caught surfing and four others were also reprimanded for putting themselves and others in danger.
“The waves are horrendous, the beaches are hazardous,” said acting Gold Coast City Council Mayor Donna Gates. “Please listen to us and stay away from the beaches. I keep repeating that because somehow, not everyone is listening.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/australia-vaping-laws-ban-intl-hnk/index.html,"Buying a vape just got harder inAustraliawith the introduction of some of the world’s toughest anti-vaping laws that limit the sale of vapes with nicotine to pharmacies.
From Monday, users will need to present a doctor’s prescription to a pharmacist to buy vapes, and the choice will be limited to three flavors: mint, menthol and tobacco.
Dozens of countries have banned disposable vapes, but with the ban on vape sales in shops, service stations and other small retailers, Australia has introduced “world leading” laws, according to the government.
Australian authorities say the move spells the end of colorful branding and fun flavors that authorities say was a ploy to get children hooked on nicotine.

“It’s not often that the parliament gets the opportunity to do something really meaningful and lasting for the health of young Australians,”said Health Minister Mark Butler,after the country’s parliamentpassed the laws.
However, under a political deal that was struck to secure the law’s approval, the restrictions will ease in October, when only minors under 18 will need a prescription.
Adults will be able to buy vapes in pharmacies, without a prescription – but the devices may be hard to find after some leading pharmacy chains declared they would refuse to stock them.
“Pharmacists are healthcare professionals and community pharmacies do not want to supply this potentially harmful, highly addictive product without a prescription,” said Anthony Tassone, thenational vice president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents over 5,900 community pharmacies nationwide.
Australia’s Greens Party had pushed for the amendments to allow adults to buy vapes without a prescription because they do not support prohibition or the criminalization of vaping.
“The prohibition of drugs has failed. The Greens are pleased that we have secured amendments to this legislation that will ensure that no person will be criminalised for personal possession of a vaping product,” Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John said in a statement.

It’s not a criminal offense to possess vapes for personal use, but the import and sale of commercial quantities of vapes will attract large fines.
Some fear the new laws will create a black market for vapes, much like one that exists for cigarettes in Australia, which imposes some of the highest tobacco taxes in the world.
A box of 20 cigarettes costs around 35 Australian dollars ($23) – considerably more than in the United States and the United Kingdom.
And the costs are expected to rise when the tobacco tax increases by another 5% in September.
Despite the rising cost of cigarettes, some fear that young vapers – having been locked out of the vape market – will turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix.
“The reality at the moment is that vapes are actually still cheaper, but with the change in legislation that uncertainty, may be making them think, ‘Well, I won’t be able to get it. Maybe I’ll move back to smoking, or maybe I’ll start smoking,’”Hester Wilson, an addiction expert at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told national broadcaster, the ABC.
Other countries are grappling with a rise in young people taking up vaping, but they’re adopting various approaches to the issue.
In June, the US Food and Drug Administrationapproved the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products,drawing harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups.
The FDA also paired with the Justice Department to create a task forceto identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes in the US.",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/style/gweagal-spears-return-scli-intl/index.html,"A British university has given backfour spearstaken more than 250 years ago from an aboriginal community in Australia by explorerCaptain James Cook.
Trinity College Cambridge permanently repatriated the spears to the La Perouse Aboriginal Community at a ceremony Tuesday, according to a joint statement from the college and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), which supported the move.
The four spears are the last remaining examples from a collection of 40 which Cook’s records show his expedition took from the Gweagal people living at Kamay on April 29, 1770.
“The spears were pretty much the first point of European contact, particularly British contact with Aboriginal Australia,” said Ray Ingrey, director of the Gujaga Foundation, a research organization working in the La Perouse community, in the statement.
“I think for us it’s a momentous occasion that where Australia’s history began, in 1770 on the shores of Botany Bay at Kurnell, the spears that were undoubtedly taken without permission are returned to the rightful people.”
Cooktraveled to Australia and New Zealand on the HMS Endeavour,marking the first known European contact with eastern Australia.
The resulting British colonization of Australia resulted in the introduction of foreign diseases, displacement, and massacres against the aboriginal people.
The spears were given to Trinity College in 1771 and have been held in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) in Cambridge since the early 20th century.
Some members of the La Perouse Aboriginal Community are direct descendants of those who crafted the spears, according to the statement.
“They are an important connection to our past, our traditions, and cultural practices, and to our ancestors,” said Noeleen Timbery, chair of the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council, in the statement.
“Our Elders have worked for many years to see their ownership transferred to the traditional owners of Botany Bay.”
The college agreed to return the spears in March 2023 after loaning them to museums in Australia in 2015 and 2020.

“This is an important day at Trinity for all parties involved in what has been a rewarding and respectful process, and ultimately a remarkable journey,” said Sally Davies, master of Trinity, in the statement.
“This is the right decision and Trinity is committed to reviewing the complex legacies of the British empire, not least in our collections.”
The spears will be displayed at a new visitor center which is going to be constructed at Kurnel, Kamay.
Cambridge’s decision to return the spears to the La Perouse community echoes recent decisions taken by other universities and cultural institutions to return artistic and cultural artifacts that were stolen or looted.
Decades of campaigning by Indigenous activistshas put pressure on museums to reconsider the provenance of collections and grapple with the cultural legacy of colonialism.",australia

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/gina-rinehart-namatjira-portrait-australia-intl-scli/index.html,"Art is subjective. And while many artists long to share their work with the world, there’s no guarantee that the audience will understand it, or even like it.
That certainly seems to be the case with a painting by indigenous artist Vincent Namatjira, which includes a portrait of Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart.
Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira’s exhibition“Australia in Colour,”from display.
The exhibition has been running at the gallery in the Australian capital, Canberra, since March.
Other subjects in the piece include the late Queen Elizabeth II, American musician Jimi Hendrix, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Vincent Lingiari and theformer Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison.
Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA’s director and chair to request the painting’s removal.
The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursdaythat it “welcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.”
“Since 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks’ Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,” the NGA statement continued. “We present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.”
Namatjira said in a statement that he paints “people who are wealthy, powerful, or significant – people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.”

“I paint the world as I see it,” he said. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’”
“Some people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,” Namatjira added.
Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock.
CNN has reached out to Hancock Prospecting for comment but did not receive a response.
Rinehart has an estimated net worth of $30.2 billion USD, according to Forbes. She “remained unshakable” at the top ofForbes’ Australia’s 50 Richest listfor 2024, the outlet reported in February.
Australia’s National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has spoken out to support Namatjira, CNN’s affiliate 9News has reported.
“While Rinehart has the right to express her opinions about the work, she does not have the authority to pressure the gallery into withdrawing the painting simply because she dislikes it,” NAVA’s executive director Penelope Benton said,according to 9News.
NAVA offered its “unwavering support” to National Gallery of Australia, 9News reported, stating that it was concerned that Rinehart’s demand to remove the portrait “sets a dangerous precedent for censorship and the stifling of creative expression.”",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/05/media/australia-esafety-drops-x-legal-action-intl-hnk/index.html,"Australia’s eSafety commissioner has dropped herlegal bid to force Elon Musk’s social media site Xto hide a violent video of a church stabbing in Sydney from global users.
Julie Inman Grant had sought a Federal Court ruling after X failed to fully comply with a takedown order issued under the country’s Online Safety Act following the incident in April.
Instead, Inman Grant said Wednesday she would “consolidate action” concerning the removal notice in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), an independent review process that examines decisions taken by the commissioner.
“After weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, I have considered this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians, especially children,” she said in a statement.
The eSafety commissioner had wanted X to hide the video for users beyond Australian borders. Musk criticized the request as an excessive overreach by an unelected official that could set a precedent for other countries to demand the removal of sensitive material.
“Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?”Musk posted on Xin April.
In a statement, X welcomed the latest development as a victory for free speech.
“This case has raised important questions on how legal powers can be used to threaten global censorship of speech, and we are heartened to see that freedom of speech has prevailed,” it said.
Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the decision to drop the case was “rational” for a public institution with limited resources. But she added that the question of Australia’s jurisdiction over online content remains unanswered.
“[Musk] might claim it’s a victory for free speech but I don’t think that is really what it is. It’s more of a corporate win, and says more about the ability of platform companies to operate outside of the reach of governments,” Gray said.
She said the end of the legal action demonstrates the need for a global approach to online regulation, adding that “it’s hard for Australia to fix these issues when it’s acting alone.”
The controversial video showed the momentBishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed, allegedly by a 16-year-old assailant, while delivering a sermon at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in western Sydney. The incident set off a riot outside the church that authorities said was stoked by the rapid distribution of the video online.
However, in court filings, lawyers for X argued that it had taken down some URLs seen by an Australian audience, but the video was readily available to view on other sites.
“The Video is, and at all material times has been, widely accessible to persons in Australia other than on the X platform, including in its full form on other social media services and various websites,” court documents said.
Musk’s lawyers also said the commissioner had failed to consider that the video was shared with the bishop’s consent, not by his assailant. The Assyrian Orthodox cleric was quoted in court filings as supporting the distribution of the video as an exercise in free speech.
“Noting our God given right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I am not opposed to [the video] remaining on social media,” the bishop said, according to court documents.
In her statement Wednesday, Inman Grant defended her decision to pursue the matter, which she said had given the agency an opportunity to test its “novel regulatory powers … to protect Australians from online harm.”
“Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community. I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made,” the statement said.
Inman Grant told Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, that she’d been subject to personal attacks, including death threats, from Musk’s supporters.
“Targeting a regulator who is here to protect the citizens of Australia is really beyond the pale, but it’s not surprising,” she reportedly told the ABC.
X, formerly known as Twitter, has faced ongoing scrutiny over the spread of controversial content on the platform, including hateful speech and conspiracy theories, since it was taken over by Musk in 2022.

https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/04/australia/cyclone-alfred-brisbane-nsw-intl-hnk/index.html,"Millions of residents alongAustralia’seastern coast are bracing for the arrival of a very slow-moving storm, the strongest tropical cyclone to threaten the region in more than 50 years.
Tropical Cyclone Alfred is expected to make landfall early Saturday with the strength of an Atlantic tropical storm. It’s swirling toward Brisbane, home to 2.5 million people, with heavy rain and wind that started pounding the area late Thursday.
Alfred is threatening a region that doesn’t normally experience cyclones; they typically form much further north, over warmer waters in the tropics. The delay in the storm’s arrival gave officials more time to issue warnings to anxious residents living in properties previously untested by cyclonic winds.
As of Friday evening local time, Cyclone Alfred was around 105 kilometers (65 miles) east of Brisbane, moving west with damaging winds around 95 kilometers per hour (59) miles per hour), according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).
The cyclone has already whipped up hazardous waves along the coast, including one measuring a record 12.3 meters (40 feet) on the Gold Coast, a popular tourist strip south of Brisbane.
The Gold Coast City Council warned of fines of $10,000 (16,000 Australian dollars) for anyone venturing too close to rock walls and rough water after injuries were reported by onlookers.
Tens of thousands of people were without power on both sides of the Queensland-New South Wales state borders early Friday, and that number was expected to grow in the hours ahead with repair work suspended until the cyclone passes.
Riverine flooding was also threatening low-lying communities. First responders received more than 1,800 calls and completed at least three flood rescues throughout Thursday and into the night, the NSW State Emergency Servicesaid on social media.
Authorities warned millions of residents in the storm’s path to prepare for destructive wind gusts, flash flooding and storm surges that may combine with high tides.
Flood watches have been issued across the coast, where rainfall of 200 to 400 millimeters (7.8 to 15.7 inches) is expected, and isolated totals nearing 500 millimeters (nearly 20 inches) are possible.
Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned late Thursday of four key challenges.
“There are waves, there is wind, there is rainfall, and there will be flooding, but none of those challenges are insurmountable, and I have every faith in the work that has been done to date,” he said.
Preparation included shutting schools, suspending public transport and closing shops and other services, leaving many with little else to do but prepare for the storm –  or marvel at large swells along the beach.
NSW Premier Chris Minns compared Alfred to a “completely unwanted house guest” – the cyclone will arrive later than expected and stay longer than planned.
“Unfortunately, that means the window for destruction in our community –  heavy rains, winds, powerful surf – is longer than we would have otherwise liked,” he said.
The last cyclone of a similar strength to cross so far south was Cyclone Zoe back in 1974, which caused major flooding in the city and NSW’s Northern Rivers region.
Brisbane’s population has more than doubled since then, but experts say the worst of Cyclone Alfred could be felt south of the storm’s eye, along popular tourist beaches from the Gold Coast to northern NSW.
“We haven’t seen anything quite like this for a good 50 years,” said Darrell Strauss, coastal management researcher at Griffith University.
“There are areas where storm surge is the biggest problem, and then there’s areas where high waves and coastal erosion and inundation from the sea directly due to the waves are a big problem. So, we’ve got a combination of all of that from Brisbane to the Northern Rivers (of NSW),” Strauss said.
Creeks and rivers in northern NSW are expected to burst their banks, threatening more devastation for residents in an area that has endured severe flooding in the past decade.
“We know that after the years of trauma that they’ve experienced, the devastating floods, going back to 2017 and of course, 2022, there is a lot of anxiety and distress in the community,” said Rose Jackson, Minister for the North Coast. “Mental health support is available.”
In Brisbane on Thursday, residents were busy stripping supermarket shelves of food and bottled water. Hundreds of thousands of sandbags were distributed, though it didn’t seem to be enough, with reports that some had resorted to stealing sand from beach volleyball courts.
Modeling showed 20,000 properties across Brisbane could be impacted by storm surge or flash flooding, according to the Lord Mayor’s office.
Beaches in northern NSW and along the Queensland coast were closed, as NSW State Emergency Services (SES) warned of potential storm surges of up to 10 meters (32 feet). It was the state’s first cyclone warning since 1990, the SES said.

The boy was disarmed and detained before police arrived on the scene Thursday at Avalon Airport in Victoria state.
Barry Clark, a passenger who tackled the suspect, said the boy had posed as a maintenance worker and became agitated when questioned by a flight attendant at the plane’s entrance.
“I looked up and then within a second I saw the barrel of a shotgun and I thought to myself that ain’t a tool that should be on a plane,” Clark told Network 10 television.
“When I saw the complete gun I said: we’re in trouble here,” Clark said.
“Then I saw it (move) towards her chest and so I thought, well, I’ve got to do something — this is all happening in a matter of seconds,” Clark added.
Clark, a former professional boxer and sheep shearer, said he snuck up behind the boy then pushed the gun and the flight attendant away in different directions so that she would not be hit if the gun discharged.
“I then proceeded to do what I had to do and just put him in a bit of a lock, got his hand and twisted it and put it up in his back, threw him to the floor and then put my knee in his back and held him in a position where he couldn’t get out,” Clark said.
Victoria Police Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters the boy from Ballarat in regional Victoria had climbed through a hole in the airport’s security fence before making his way to the plane’s stairs.
Reid credited Clark, the pilot and another passenger with restraining the boy.
“This would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers of that plane and Victoria Police really commend the bravery of those passengers who were able to overpower that male,” Reid said.
Sydney-bound Jetstar Airways Flight 610 was carrying about 150 people and no one was hurt, police said. The flight was cancelled.
An investigation was being carried out by crime squad detectives with no involvement from the police force’s counterterrorism unit.
The boy has been charged with multiple offenses including unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, orchestrating a bomb hoax and possessing a firearm, a police statement said. He was remanded in custody to appear in a children’s court on a date to be determined.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australian airports had robust security.
“This incident is concerning for members of the public. I commend the work of police and aviation officials in responding to it quickly,” Albanese told reporters.
Avalon Airport’s chief executive Ari Suss said his organization was working with Victoria Police in response to the emergency.
“As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we have implemented further measures across the airport, including within the terminal and surrounding areas,” Suss said in a statement.
“We continue to work closely with authorities to maintain a safe and secure environment for all travelers,” he added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes/index.html,"Sydney, 1994. A dimly-lit bar, wrapped in tinsel curtains and the fragmented, twirling light from a disco ball. Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as hisdrag personaMitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig.
This is the opening scene from “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month.
“I made that dress for myself,” Tim Chappel, one of the movie’s costume designers, told CNN. “The weekend before, I’d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film’s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film ), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag)  to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I’d already made it, so it was cheap!”
In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west — both musically and literally — for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
“We were just having a laugh!” Chappel said, recalling the film’s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for.
“It was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn’t going to let anybody stand in my way,” Chappel said. “I just really wanted to make (the film’s wardrobe) unique and interesting.”
Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed “Priscilla” the “darling” of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designerLizzy Gardineran Oscar in 1995.
Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or ‘thong,’ if you’re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother’s staff discount — “which was good,” he said, “because that was about three quarters of our budget.” Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, “made with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape”, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though — that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape.
Related articleThe US has a rich drag history. Here’s why the art form will likely outlast attempts to restrict it
Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor’s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio’s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all.
“I think that’s definitely one of the most iconic looks,” drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time “Priscilla” was hitting screens.
“The thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that’s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That’s the beauty of ‘Priscilla’: they’ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.”
“The art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,” she continued. “’Priscilla’ showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early ‘90s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn’t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It’s what you do with it that makes the difference… I’ve been replicating (Chappel’s) costumes for 30 years, so I’ve got a lot to thank him for!”

These creations also follow the “drab to fab” ethos: they’re made from materials bought at the hardware store. “I remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry’s head, and that made me laugh a little,” Bocks said. “Of course, by the time I’d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.”
Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from “Priscilla” is Adam/ Felicia’s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lamé. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce “Spirit of Ecstasy” bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script’s guidance.
Felicia’s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti — a reflection of the community’s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. “Priscilla” received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point:new HIV treatmentswere being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. “All of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,” he said. ““Priscilla”, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.”
Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to “Priscilla” is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join “Priscilla’s” musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel’s costumes since 2006. The film’s legacy can also be seen in Australia’s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on “Rupaul’s Drag Race Down Under”.
“If I get run over by a bus tomorrow,” Chappel said, “the last little thought that goes through my head – besides ‘ouch’ – is going to be ‘I’ve left an impression, that’s cool’.”",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/australia-mona-museum-picasso-restroom-intl-hnk/index.html,"Editor’s Note: In July 2024, the ‘Picasso’ artworks detailed in this story were subsequentlyrevealed to be fakescreated by museum curator Kirsha Kaechele.
A museum in Australia has moved Picasso artworks to a women’s restroom, skirting a discrimination complaint by a male visitor who couldn’t enter an exhibit where the works were previously hung.
Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele’s “Ladies Lounge” installation at Tasmania’s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) –  which opened in December 2020 – “to any and all ladies.”
The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a “tremendously lavish space” where women can indulge in “decadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures” served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room.
But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to “persons who do not identify as ladies” after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia’s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act.
Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art — giving them a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history.
The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed “Ladies Room,” located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail.
“While the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I’ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,” she added. “Some Cubism in the cubicles.”
On Monday, Kaechele posted onInstagrama video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum.
She encouraged “all ladies” to enjoy the new exhibition.
“We never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn’t know what to do with all those Picassos…,” wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA’s owner, David Walsh.
Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the “Ladies Lounge” exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination.
“He felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,” read the tribunal’s notes.

After the judgment, Kaechelesaidshe would challenge the court’s decision in the state’s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the “Ladies Lounge” concept.
Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn’t have to open to men.
Kaechele later discussed potential ways to reopen “Ladies Lounge” as a church, school, toilet and more in aQ&Athat was published on the museum’s website.",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/style/lisa-michele-burns-australia-landscape-photographer-hnk-spc-c2e/index.html,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiativehas partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
WhenLisa Michele Burnsset out to photograph Australia in 2022, she didn’t quite realize how enormous it was.
She recalled a growing sense of panic on the second of her two four-month road trips as she drove down the never-ending highway to the outback, surrounded by nothing but rust-orange dirt, spiky spinifex grass, and the occasional gray-green mulga tree.
“That road, it’s just — it’s so straight,” said Burns. “There was a point where I had to pull over and go, ‘What are we doing? This place is so big.’”
Despite growing up in Australia — moving from itssouthern coastline, where bushland rolls into the sea, up to the Whitsunday Islands in central Queensland — Burns, 40, has spent most of her career abroad, capturing images ofAlpine peaks, serene bamboo forests and Mediterranean coastlines.
“I probably knew more about Greenland than I did the center of Australia,” she said.
But during the coronavirus pandemic, she found herself at home, unable to travel abroad. “It became an opportunity for me to see Australia.”
Focusing on the “vibrant color palette” of Australia’s landscapes, Burns traversed the country, accompanied by her partner, to capture its diversity, from ocean blues to white sand beaches, dense green forests to rich red desert plains.
Exploring places she’d never visited, Burns found a new appreciation for her birthplace — and hopes that the images, compiled in her photobook, “Sightlines,” published lastDecember by Images Publishing Group, can preserve the “indescribable magic” of Australia’s landscapes while sparking conversations about how to protect much-beloved natural wonders.
“I think it’s important to appreciate the variety of landscapes across Australia, but to also document them as they are today, because they are changing,” said Burns.
Due to pandemic restrictions and seasonal weather, Burns planned the trip in two halves — the first around the East coast, covering Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the second half across South and Western Australia, and the Northern Territory — spending around eight months of 2022 on the road.
While Burns plotted the route on Google Maps and researched locations ahead of the trip, she found that on the road, often different “palettes and patterns” grabbed her attention.
“A lot of the places that became my favorite spots weren’t actually ones that I’d researched,” she said.
After finishing up earlyat a location in Southern Australia, Burns turned down a small road that led to Sheringa Beach, a location that became a highlight of her trip. “There was nobody else there, just us and these dunes that just roll into the turquoise sea,” she recalled.
In Western Australia, Burns visited Gantheaume Point, a “touristy spot” famous for its fossilized dinosaur footprints that surprised her with unusual patterns and vibrant colors formed in the sandstone over millennia. “I was mesmerized for days,” she said.
The photos in “Sightlines” focus more on the “smaller details within a landscape,” said Burns, providing a deeper understanding and connection with the environment. For example, the desert often appears barren and inhospitable, a huge stretch of empty sand and sky with “nothing really surviving,” said Burns: “But once you take a closer look, there are so many beautiful flora and fauna that exist in these extreme conditions.”
While Burns describes herself as an optimist and focused on the beauty of the country’s landscapes, she could see the impacts of climate change.
In the past decade, Australia has seen increasinglyextreme weather eventsas a result of environmental damage, including intense droughts and storms, bushfires and rising sea levels.
For Burns, this was most visible around the reefs and coastlines, where rising temperatures causecoral bleaching, which reached “catastrophic levels” in the Great Barrier Reef in 2024. Last year was thehottest year on recordglobally, and Australia’s average temperature has increased by1.51 Celsiussince 1910, when records began.
And while driving through Southern Australia, Burns saw the aftermath of the2019-2020 bushfires, during which more than 10 million hectares of land burned and over a billion animals areestimated to have died. “That was incredible to see. That’s where my family’s from, and I knew how huge the fires were and the impact that they had,” she said. But across the scarred landscape, Burns could “see the forest regenerating.”
“I think it is important to form a collective visual of what these landscapes look like today,” she said, adding: “Photography can raise awareness about climate change, even if it’s through beautiful imagery rather than hardcore documentary imagery. A good balance of the two across media is really important.”
Even for a landscape photographer, though, some scenes cannot be captured.
When Burns finally reached the Red Center, a landscape she’d heard so much about but never seen for herself, she felt the indescribable awe ofUluṟu— one of the world’s largest sandstone monoliths and one of Australia’s most iconic landmarks — and itsred hue against the blue sky: “I didn’t realize how significant that would feel.”
Nearby, in the Valley of the Winds, no photos are allowed because it issacredto the Aṉangu people: but for Burns, it was “one of the highlights of the entire trip,” giving her a new level of connection with the landscape.
“We layon a platform and listened to the wind funneling down between the domes, and the birdsong,” she said. “That was really magic, because you do need to look around and observe to get those creative ideas. You just need to put the camera down, sometimes.”",australia
https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/03/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-death-scli-intl/index.html,"James Harrison, a prolific Australianblood donorfamed for having saved the lives of more than two million babies, has died at age 88.
Harrison, whose plasma contained a “rare and precious antibody” known as Anti-D, donated blood more than 1,100 times, according to Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, which confirmed his death in a statement published Saturday.
Harrison, who was known as the “Man with the Golden Arm,” died in his sleep at a nursing home north of Sydney on February 17, according to the statement.
Harrison’s altruistic mission was driven by having received multiple blood transfusions following lung surgery at the age of 14.
He started donating plasma at 18 and did so every two weeks until he was 81, the upper age limit for blood donation in Australia.
Lifeblood Chief Executive Officer Stephen Cornelissen hailed Harrison’s dedication.

“James was a remarkable, stoically kind, and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,” Cornelissen said in the statement.
“James extended his arm to help others and babies he would never know a remarkable 1173 times and expected nothing in return.”
Harrison’s daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father “was a humanitarian at heart.”
“As an Anti-D recipient myself, he has left behind a family that may not have existed without his precious donations,” she said in the statement.
“He was also very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain. It made him happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness.”
Anti-D is used to make a medication administered to pregnant mothers whose blood would attack their unborn babies’ blood cells, known as rhesus disease.
The condition develops when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from its father.

If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the baby’s “foreign” blood cells.
In the worst cases, babies can be brain damaged or die.
Anti-D, produced with Harrison’s antibodies, prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during pregnancy.
The discovery of Harrison’s antibodies was an absolute game-changer, Australian officials said.
“In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn’t know why, and it was awful. Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage,” Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service,told CNN in 2015.
“Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time.”
Considered a national hero, Harrison won numerous awards for his generosity, including the Medal of the Order of Australia, one of the country’s highest honors.
